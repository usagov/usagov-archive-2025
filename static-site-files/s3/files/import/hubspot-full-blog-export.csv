<p>We asked our teams to share the work they were most proud of in 2024:</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><!--more--></p>
<p>“This past year, the PX Contact Center supported the Department of State during critical crises throughout the world, including Lebanon and Syria. The team swiftly established and optimized communication lines to provide timely support to those impacted. Whether coordinating updates to IVR messages for callers or standing up 24/7 hotlines and seamless workflows under urgent conditions, the contact center played a pivotal role in delivering efficient, empathetic service.” - <em>PX Contact Center</em></p>
<p>“2024 was a big year for helping people find the government benefits they need. Following an extensive audit by our team of the former DOL website Benefits.gov, we created a streamlined experience on our USAGov sites to connect the public with the benefits they need. Through user experience research and usability testing, we enhanced our <a href=""http://www.usa.gov/benefit-finder""><span>benefit finder tool</span></a>, making it easier for users to filter by topic or answer a few questions to find important benefits they may be eligible for. Decommissioning Benefits.gov and transitioning into our websites saved taxpayers at least $4.4 million in agency contributions for the operation of Benefits.gov.” - <em>Benefit Finder and Benefits.gov Transition Team</em></p>
<p>“We kept people connected with critical information before, during, and after Hurricanes Helene and Milton. We sent and amplified hundreds of messages to our over 2 million subscribers and followers on social media along with key safety and life-saving messaging from dozens of agency partners. The messaging, along with more than 540,000 visits to the USAGov hurricane-related pages in September and October, showed we engaged people with the information they needed precisely when they needed it.” - <em>Outreach and Content</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;“<a href=""http://search.gov/""><span>Search.gov</span></a> launched a new faceted search feature in beta and continued to provide a service to government agencies, saving money on their own search needs."" <em>- Search.gov</em></p>
<p>“We empowered people to recognize a scam and to know how to report it. Using visitor data and user tests, we rebuilt our <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/where-report-scams""><span>where to report a scam</span></a> wizard, adding step-by-step information to help people confidently stand up for themselves and get the government support they need to battle scammers. The tool aggregates information from across the government in one interactive space for people to take action--principles that are at the core of what USAGov does.” - <em>USAGov</em></p>
<p>“We made some changes to the back end of USA.gov that made a big difference for users. For example, we added the USPS API to validate a user's address in the <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials""><span>contact your elected officials</span></a> tool. The USPS API lets us tell the user if the address they entered isn't valid and allows them to update it to get the accurate, personalized information they need instead of going into an error loop. This saves them time and frustration, and gives us an opportunity to experiment even more with APIs in 2025.” - <em>Engineering</em></p>
<p>“This year we increased our focus on serving people from the disability community. We recruited people who use assistive technology to navigate government information online to take part in interview studies. The research confirmed that screen reader navigation requires clear website labeling, that videos and content that moves or refreshes hinder accessibility, and that using ARIA regions in coding helps people with assistive technologies understand the different parts of a website. This research and resulting website changes boosted our accessibility score to 96.1%. That exceeds the government accessibility benchmark by more than 8 points.” -<em> User Experience and Accessibility</em></p>

To help people across the country prepare for and recover from disasters, we use different tactics across our channels.</p>
<p>These tips can help your organization deliver timely information to your audience during a disaster.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Ask your visitors and followers to sign up for emergency alerts</strong>. To ensure they stay aware, urge your followers to sign up for emergency alerts from their local government, FEMA, the National Weather Service, and more. These text messages, apps, and radio alerts can <a href=""https://www.ready.gov/alerts""><span>help anyone have the most updated emergency information available</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Have a content bank ready to go.</strong> Our organization relies on information developed both internally and by agency partners before, during, and after an emergency. This could include storm-specific tips, apps to use on the fly, and predictions and mapping. The pre-developed content allows us to tailor to specific storm needs and add hashtags like #Milton or #Helene to increase findability online. Our go-to websites include:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1""><a href=""https://www.ready.gov/""><span>Ready.gov</span></a> - A multilingual public service campaign run through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) with storm-specific information, planning guidance, and information for individuals, families, businesses, and communities</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Follow FEMA’s social media accounts.</strong> FEMA shares timely information that people impacted by disasters need. Follow and constantly check their social media accounts for immediate updates as a storm develops. FEMA HQ is on<span style=""font-size: 17px;""> <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/FEMA/"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/fema/?hl=en"">Instagram</a>, and <a href=""http://twitter.com/fema"">X (Twitter)</a>,</span> and has additional accounts across FEMA’s 10 regions and sub-programs like Ready.gov.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ensure content is accessible even if there are connectivity issues.</strong> During emergencies, it is very common for areas to have reduced connectivity. Share information that doesn’t take long to load and doesn’t require a strong internet connection. For example, we include key information that people need in the text of the post itself. Don’t make those in the path or survivors of a storm have to click on a link to get the most essential information as connectivity might be an issue. Relying just on graphics and videos to convey your key messages may also pose problems for those who can’t access them.</p>
<p><strong>Plan for different audiences. </strong>Emergencies can impact everybody. In addition to creating messaging for the general public, consider developing content for various geographic regions and <a href=""https://www.ready.gov/communities""><span>different demographic groups</span></a> too, including:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Parents with young children</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Pet owners</li>

USAGov Blog,Building a tool to make mail-in voter registration more accessible,Building a tool to make mail-in voter registration more accessible,en,/blog/2024/10/building-a-tool-to-make-mail-in-voter-registration-more-accessible,Claire Loxsom,"Content,Design and Development,Marketing,Multilingual",How vote.gov and the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) created a form filler to make voter registration easier.,2024-10-22 12:05:49,2024-12-04T20:49:59.427Z,"<p style=""line-height: 1.5;"">At vote.gov, our mission is to make it easy for all eligible voters to understand how to register and vote. That’s why we’ve partnered with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to create a tool that helps people more easily fill out the National Mail Voter Registration Form.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><!--more--></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><a href=""https://www.eac.gov/voters/national-mail-voter-registration-form""><span>The National Mail Voter Registration Form</span></a> is one way many U.S. citizens can register to vote for the first time or update their registration with a new name, address, or in some states, political party. Vote.gov itself does not register voters or store any personal data. Instead, we direct users to register directly with their state or territory, whether online, in person, or through the National Mail Voter Registration Form, which is accepted by most states.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;"">In the past, voters would have to fill out the form by hand or using PDF-filler software. The new form filler tool on vote.gov allows eligible voters to fill out their registration form online before printing, signing, and mailing it to their state election office. The tool also simplifies the 20-page PDF into a clear, step-by-step process in which users only see the information they need based on their state.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><strong>Designed with every voter in mind</strong></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;"">We designed the form filler tool to remove barriers that make filling out the form feel overwhelming or complicated. <span style=""font-size: 17px; color: #444746;"">Here are some features that make it a more accessible experience for voters</span>:&nbsp;</p>
<ul style=""line-height: 1.5;"">
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Screen reader accessibility</strong>: The tool follows best practices for screen reader compatibility, ensuring voters with visual impairments can easily navigate and complete the form.</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Customizable display</strong>: It supports web tools that allow users to adjust font size, change the display, or modify contrast settings for better visibility.</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Responsive, mobile-friendly design</strong>: Unlike PDFs, the tool works seamlessly across different devices, including phones, tablets, and computers, providing a smooth user experience.</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Inline help text</strong>: State-specific instructions appear next to related questions, helping voters quickly and accurately fill out their forms.</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Multilingual support</strong>: Currently available in English and Spanish, the form filler will expand to additional languages in the future, ensuring broader accessibility for voters with limited English proficiency.</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>State election office information</strong>: The form filler tool automatically provides the correct mailing address for the voter’s state or territory election office, so they don’t have to search for it themselves</li>
</ul>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><strong>Improving the experience for states, too</strong></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;"">The benefits of the form filler tool extend beyond the individual user. By producing typed, legible forms instead of handwritten ones, it reduces errors and helps state election offices process forms more efficiently. The tool is also designed to prevent missing information by requiring users to fill out all necessary fields before proceeding. This feature ensures the form is complete and accurate, saving both voters and election officials time.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;"">In addition, the tool prompts users to check if they’re already registered, helping to avoid duplicate registrations. And for those in states that offer online registration, the tool alerts users to that option, potentially saving them even more time.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><strong>The new vote.gov&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-size: 17px;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">We continue to collect feedback on the form filler tool and are committed to accessibility in all design and content improvements. The form filler tool is just one way vote.gov is making it easier to learn how to register and vote. </span><a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/introducing-the-new-vote.gov"">Learn about vote.gov’s recent website refresh and new features.</a></span><span style=""font-size: 12px; color: #000000;""> </span></p>",https://532040.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/532040/FY%2025Blog_WelcomeNewVote_DRAFTS%2810.21.24%29_v003.png,,PUBLISHED,false

<h1 style=""text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;""><strong>From Benefits.gov to USAGov</strong></h1>
<p style=""text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;"">To deliver this new experience, we assembled a product team made up of functional leads, including product managers, user research and experience specialists, content strategists, and developers. The leads worked with their individual teams to:</p>
<ul style=""text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;"">
<li aria-level=""1"">Conduct an exhaustive content audit of Benefits.gov&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Study data from both Benefits.gov and our own websites to prioritize topics and federal benefit programs people need most&nbsp;</li>

<p style=""text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;"">As we enhanced our benefits content, we conducted comparative usability testing. We asked participants to complete tasks on both Benefits.gov and our redesigned benefits pages. This direct user feedback helped us iteratively improve our wording, topic order, content structure, and more. We also added a category filter to the benefit finder to streamline information by specific types to help users find benefits more quickly.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;"">As people are discovering the benefit finder and other federal benefits information on USAGov’s websites, our work continues.

And planning for accessibility begins before we create a single piece of code. Learn how developers from our Web Operations team and specialists from our Accessibility team work closely to create an inclusive digital experience.</p>
<!--more-->
<h1 style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Partnering from the start</h1>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Our developers and accessibility specialists learned that it’s best to work together from the beginning on projects, instead of conducting accessibility reviews after websites and features have been developed. This partnership from the start reduces rework and avoids potential delays in releasing our products to the public.&nbsp;</p>
<h1 style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Understanding requirements and standards</h1>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Accessibility specialists help developers understand how to implement new and established accessibility standards that federal websites need to meet. These include the <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/""><span>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</span></a>, the international standard for web content accessibility, and <a href=""https://www.section508.gov/""><span>Section 508</span></a> of the Rehabilitation Act, which requires federal websites and electronic resources to be accessible.&nbsp;</p>
<h1 style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Creating and testing accessible design and code</h1>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Members of the two teams use shared tools and processes to develop accessible design and code. During regular reviews and feedback sessions, a specialist evaluates the accessibility of web design elements like color contrast, font sizes, and heading hierarchy, as well as code. We manually test with screen readers and keyboard navigation, and do automated testing with tools like WAVE and ANDI to highlight accessibility issues and suggest fixes. By doing this testing on a local environment, accessibility experts and developers catch coding errors before they’re pushed to the development, stage, and production environments. This ensures all content, design elements, and interactive features are accessible and creates an inclusive and frustration-free experience for users.</p>
<h1 style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Planning and communication</h1>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;"">We do our work in sprints. Each sprint begins with developers refining the backlog of tasks in our project management tool. Tasks are prioritized by a team that includes a product manager, lead engineer, and team manager. Task assignments and communication happen, while task updates are staged and approved in the software development platform to integrate fixes into the development, stage, and production environments. We conduct tests in each environment to verify that we’ve resolved issues. During sprints, we meet twice a week to go over weekly tasks and address any issues that have come up. Accessibility team members answer questions the developers may have about a function or tool they’re building. At the end of the sprint, the developer and accessibility teams conduct a retrospective to discuss things that did or didn’t work and how to improve the process.</p>
<h1 style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Ongoing collaboration</h1>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Our teams continue to look for ways to improve our accessibility development process by reviewing the work we’ve done together and planning our next steps. And by keeping communication flowing, we’re building good relationships and a strong collaborative partnership as we’re making government information accessible for everyone.</p>",https://532040.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/532040/FY24%20Blog-HDASW_%2809.16.24%29.png,,PUBLISHED,false

The process begins with our iterative multilingual user research. </span></span></p>
<!--more-->
<h1 style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Bilingual support teams</h1>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-size: 17px;"">We created and continue to improve the benefit finder with a fully bilingual, cross-functional team of native and fluent English and Spanish speakers. The team includes a bilingual researcher, data analyst, designer, content strategist, and project manager. The ongoing collaboration among team members helps us provide feedback and analyze user sessions in English and Spanish in real time. It also embeds a multicultural editorial process throughout the benefit finder’s development cycle.</span></p>
<h1 style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Dual-track language research</h1>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-size: 17px;"">User research has been essential in aligning the benefit finder with the needs and cultural nuances of our English and Spanish-speaking audiences. We have tested early, often, and iteratively. From the inception of the benefit finder, we adopted a dual-track research approach, testing in both languages. We delved into users' perceptions of the benefit finder, their past experiences using government sites, and how the benefit finder compares with their expectations. We also prioritized mobile testing since it represents more than 60% of traffic to USAGov’s websites.</span></p>
<h1 style=""line-height: 1.5;"">ABC research</h1>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-size: 17px;"">Showing research participants more than one potential version of the benefit finder’s content helped uncover observations we wouldn’t find with typical user testing. In traditional A/B testing, we would show each participant only one of two versions of a design. Participants would provide minor recommendations but did not suggest significant changes. While this approach confirmed the content's accuracy, cultural relevance, and readability, it limited feedback to just that one version. Using ABC testing methodology, we showed two to four versions to each research participant. With this approach, we gathered comments we may not have otherwise. This more nuanced feedback led us to create noticeably different content for each language. Spanish speakers, for example, preferred longer and more polite content, with extra empathetic lines and words like “please.” English speakers preferred a minimalistic approach with only the necessary content and no extra niceties, like the word “please.”</span></p>
<h1 style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Diversity screening</h1>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-size: 17px;"">A key aspect of our research was testing with diverse groups of people who represent the breadth of the benefit finder’s audience. We used screening criteria to recruit a variety of participants in the areas of gender, age, and geographic distribution. And we reached out to underrepresented groups like people with disabilities. We also screened for people who recently applied or were looking to apply for benefits or who had gone through one of the life events on the benefit finder: the death of a loved one, retirement, or disability. Emulating realistic scenarios helped us gather more realistic feedback. For example, a participant who lost a loved one could empathize better with others going through that process and how they would interact and feel when using the benefit finder.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-size: 17px;"">Recruiting diverse Spanish speakers was also important. A Spanish speaker can encompass a wide range of language proficiency and cultural diversity. The Latino and Hispanic populations in the U.S., sometimes referred to as a mosaic, are diverse, representing many cultural subgroups and different forms of the Spanish language. Because of this, we intentionally recruited users who were fluent in Spanish and represented the broader Spanish-speaking communities. Our research included U.S.-born and immigrant users from Mexico, the Caribbean, Spain, and Central and South America. Casting a wider net allowed us to have a broader range of feedback to understand the needs of specific user segments. It also helped us disaggregate data across different benefit screening criteria.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h1 style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Recruitment challenges</h1>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-size: 17px;"">The onboarding process for the research platform we were using seemed complex and time-consuming to users, and it was only available in English. This limited us to testing people who could speak English, had a high commitment to testing, or had high digital literacy. But this didn’t fully represent the average user for the benefit finder, especially in Spanish.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-size: 17px;"">Another related challenge was that although we screened to recruit fluent and native Spanish speakers, most Spanish-speaking participants were proficient in English and preferred using websites in English because they felt they were more accurate, clearer, and easier to use. While these participants provided helpful feedback about the product's language and cultural aspects, we were mindful that they didn’t represent a typical user who requires a Spanish site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-size: 17px;"">Cognizant of this, we implemented several approaches to address these barriers. We added extra screening to ensure that we recruited Spanish speakers with limited English proficiency. We relied on community connections and local networks and attended in-person events to recruit participants we would not encounter through commercial research platforms. To help onboard participants, we created step-by-step Spanish documentation to guide them in navigating the research platform.</span></p>
<h1 style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Ongoing research</h1>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-size: 17px;""><span style=""color: #0e101a;"">Since launching the benefit finder in January 2024, we’ve continued the multicultural process of testing iterative product improvements and new features of the benefit finder.

<!--more-->
<h1>Study overview</h1>
<p>We teamed up with a local organization to reach out to people who use assistive technology. We were fortunate to meet with a diverse group which included 10 people who identified as legally blind users who require screen readers. Six mentioned they were blind since birth, and at least 4 also identified as being deaf. Seven of our participants were Braille hardware users.</p>
<p><img src=""https://532040.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/532040/A%20screengrab%20of%20the%20participant%20breakdown%20for%20the%20assistive%20technology%20study..png"" width=""1109"" height=""471"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""A screengrab of the participant breakdown for the assistive technology study."" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 1109px;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;""><em>Caption: The participation breakdown as presented in the assistive technology study report. Each shape represents a participant, including those who are legally blind, blind since birth, deaf, and use braille hardware, screen magnifiers, contrast, and screen readers.</em></p>
<p>We conducted generative conversation studies so we could speak with participants in an open-ended way rather than being tied to a strict set of questions. This helped us connect better with participants and yielded richer data. We structured our conversations to uncover patterns in participants’ information-seeking behavior and learn about their preferred channels of communication. Our goal was to learn about their pain points and highlights of communicating with the federal government, while also gaining a broader understanding of the accessibility experience on USA.gov.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Habits of assistive technology users</h1>
<p>Through our conversations, we found that most of the participants were able to interact with the government online successfully. And we identified several habits of these assistive technology users.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Everyone uses assistive technology differently. The people we spoke with tend to use only familiar websites or those recommended by people they trust.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Most said mobile sites are easier for them to use because they are typically simpler, with less to manage.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Assistive technology users have a natural inclination to skip website carousels as they have found these elements not always accessible based on their previous experience. They also don’t always wait for the screen reader to finish reading, which can lead to missed content, especially with long labels.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Participants typically use the screen reader search capability which searches just the page. They didn’t frequently use the search box which searches the entire site.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Confirming some accessibility basics</h1>
<p>Participants confirmed a few things we knew about accessibility.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Clear heading levels are important for serving as critical markers for screen reader navigation.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Sites that have moving or refreshing content or videos can pose challenges for accessibility.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Using specific action-oriented descriptions rather than generic terms like “click here” or “see below” helps users know what to expect when they click a link.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What we learned about user interface design&nbsp;</h1>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Sometimes an action a user takes while navigating a website is a wayfinding, especially when visual cues are absent. For example, when a user opens an accordion, the action of doing so functions like a bookmark, helping the user maintain their orientation on the page.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">The accessible name of something should match the on-screen text for it. The accessible name is the information that assistive technology uses to identify the element, and it can be derived from the element's content, attributes, or associated elements. Assistive technology such as screen readers and Braille displays will announce the accessible name aloud and also read the on-screen text. When they are not the same, it can be confusing and cause extra cognitive load for the individual.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Technical takeaways&nbsp;</h1>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">It is really helpful to use ARIA labels (Accessible Rich Internet Applications). These labels are part of the code on a web page. ARIA regions are like street signs to help people who use assistive technology understand what different parts of the website do and navigate the content more efficiently.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Screen readers struggle with terms such as “drop down” or “toggle” for interactive elements because these terms do not sufficiently describe the functionality or state of the element. For example, if a menu is labeled as ""drop down,” a screen reader may not understand that it can be expanded or collapsed, and may not communicate what kind of information is within the drop-down. Labeling an element as “toggle” does not inform the user of whether the toggle has been switched or not. Using wording within the code that does convey the state of the element, such as “aria_checked” for a toggle switch or “aria-pressed” for a button that has been pressed ensures the interactive elements communicate their purpose and state clearly, making for a vastly improved accessible interaction.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Hierarchy of levels and subsets in the code helps the user navigate content and elements such as the heading and section structures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through these generative conversation studies, we have gained valuable insights into the disability community. Our findings highlight important habits and challenges related to technology and accessibility. These insights not only inform our current practices but also guide future improvements in product design and implementation. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Making our link labeling clearer</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Creating an easier way for assistive technology users to search for information about their state or territory</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Investigating ways to help keyboard users skip to main content faster</li>
</ul>
<p>By continually refining our approach, we continue to enhance the accessibility and effectiveness of government services for everyone.</p>",https://532040.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/532040/FY24%20Assistive%20Tech%20Study.png,,PUBLISHED,false

<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-size: 17px;"">After the November 2022 midterm elections, the <a href=""https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/us-election-assistance-commission-study-disability-and-voting-accessibility-2022"">Election Assistance Commission (EAC) estimated</a> that if voters with disabilities had voted at the same rates as voters without disabilities, there would be around 2 million more votes cast. The EAC also found that people with disabilities voted at a 3.6 percent lower rate than people without disabilities, though that number narrowed to 1.5 percent after being adjusted with updated Census data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-size: 17px;""><span style=""color: #1d1c1d;"">Accessibility matters both in person and online. As an official government source of voting information, </span><a href=""https://vote.gov/"">vote.gov</a><span style=""color: #1d1c1d;""> helps voters with disabilities know that their voting rights are protected by law. And it makes them aware of accommodations available to help them register and vote.</span></span></p>
<!--more-->
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;"">In addition to providing information about how to vote, we’re also actively making improvements to vote.gov’s website design to make sure it’s as accessible as possible. This includes<span style=""color: #000000;""> screen reader compatibility, high-contrast designs, and plain language</span>. Here’s how we’ve accomplished this so far.</p>
<h1 style=""line-height: 1.5;""><strong>Accessibility testing&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Our team conducts accessibility testing on all vote.gov web pages before we roll out new content. This helps us make sure each page is compatible with zoom magnification, keyboards, and screen readers. We also added an <a href=""https://vote.gov/sitemap/""><span>HTML sitemap</span></a> to allow for multiple methods of navigation to various web pages on vote.gov.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;"">To improve the accessibility of the <a href=""https://www.eac.gov/voters/national-mail-voter-registration-form""><span>National Mail Voter Registration Form</span></a>, we partnered with the EAC to build a digital form filler tool. Voters will be able to select their state and get the specific instructions they need based on their state. This streamlines over 20 pages of instructions from the original PDF registration form. The digital form filler tool will be mobile-friendly and provide a better screen reader experience. We plan to launch the tool on vote.gov in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>
<h1 style=""line-height: 1.5;""><strong>Gathering research and feedback&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;"">We’ve worked with disability advocacy groups representing several types of conditions (limited vision, cognitive disabilities, and more) and integrated their feedback. And we partnered with the <a href=""https://www.wsblind.org/""><span>World Services for the Blind</span></a> to recruit 10 research participants for 30-45 minute phone and video sessions focused on the readability and usefulness of vote.gov content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;"">If you are disabled and/or use assistive technology and would like to share feedback about your experience using the vote.gov website, <a href=""https://touchpoints.app.cloud.gov/touchpoints/c666af50/submit""><span>you can sign up using this form</span></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h1 style=""line-height: 1.5;""><strong>An ongoing commitment to accessibility&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;"">It’s important to us that people are aware of vote.gov’s commitment to accessibility and have a way to share their feedback. To that end, we:</p>
<ul style=""line-height: 1.5;"">
<li style=""color: #000000;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""color: #1d1c1d;"">Developed an </span><a href=""https://vote.gov/accessibility/""><span>accessibility statement</span></a><span style=""color: #1d1c1d;""> that is unique to vote.gov and outlines our commitment to making vote.gov accessible to people of all abilities&nbsp;</span></li>

<h1 style=""line-height: 1.5;""><strong>What’s coming up next&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.5;"">While we’re proud of our progress so far, the work is far from complete. Here’s what else is in the pipeline:&nbsp;</p>
<ul style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.5;"">
<li aria-level=""1"">We’re conducting more usability testing with people who have situational limitations (limited access to the internet, rural citizens, etc.) and physical and cognitive disabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">We’re working on a display toggle to make sure people with low vision and other conditions can customize their view of vote.gov by enlarging the text and/or changing the contrast. This feature came directly from user feedback from the <a href=""https://civicdesign.org/""><span>Center for Civic Design</span></a>.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Research tells us voting terms can be confusing. We’re workshopping ways to add definitions on our pages to make it easier for people to understand complicated voting terms and phrases (such as “ballot measures” and “caucus”).&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">We’re testing our back-end content management system (CMS) for accessibility so vote.gov designers, developers, and other team members with disabilities can help contribute to the maintenance of vote.gov.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.5;"">Our goal is for all voters to have equal access to our website and find information about their voting options and rights. We are always open to feedback. Email us at <a href=""mailto:section508-vote@gsa.gov""><span>section508-vote@gsa.gov</span></a> if you have ideas we could incorporate to make vote.gov an even more accessible and inclusive experience.</p>",https://532040.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/532040/FY24%20Blog%20Cover%20VoteAccessibility.png,,PUBLISHED,false

<p style=""line-height: 1.5; font-size: 17px;"">You might find that adding meta descriptions can bring people to your agency’s websites. These three tips can help you get started.</p>
<h1>Identify the most common words people use to search</h1>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5; font-size: 17px;"">We use web analytic tools, like Google Analytics, to find keywords to include in our meta descriptions. While meta descriptions don’t directly improve search engine optimization, they can help users find our content quickly.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5; font-size: 17px;"">Search engines’ algorithms often use a page's meta description in search results, but not always. Other times, they use snippets of text from the page that better match a user's search query. Knowing what words searchers use to locate information, and putting them in your meta descriptions, can increase the chances that search engines will use your meta descriptions. It can also boost your page’s popularity.</p>
<h1>Write engaging meta descriptions</h1>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5; font-size: 17px;"">Engaging meta descriptions can entice searchers to click through to your content. We use active voice and include calls to action (“find,” “learn,” “see,” “know”). We also use natural and plain language and match the overall voice and tone of our websites. We base our meta descriptions on our page introductions but modify them to ensure they include keywords.</p>
<h1>Create unique meta descriptions</h1>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5; font-size: 17px;"">It takes time and talent to craft a good meta description. When we redesigned our websites in 2023, our USA.gov and USAGov en Español content designers and editors used analytics to identify the keywords for each page. Then, within a limit of 120 to 158 characters, we wrote unique meta descriptions for our sites’ 400+ web pages based on those keywords.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5; font-size: 17px;"">As part of our content workflow, we now include meta descriptions when creating new pages. We study user data to help assess the meta descriptions’ effectiveness and update them during content reviews throughout the year.</p>",https://532040.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/532040/FY24%20Three%20tips%20for%20using%20meta%20descriptions.png,,PUBLISHED,false

Last year, we shared posts highlighting how we used those principles to shift our approaches to <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/a-new-approach-to-content-for-usagovs-beta-sites""><span>content development</span></a>, <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/5-changes-the-ux-team-made-for-beta""><span>user experience</span></a>, and <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/measuring-beta-are-we-on-the-right-track""><span>analytics</span></a>.</p>

<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">Between bi-weekly check-ins, pre-sprint meetings, and post-sprint retros, we continue to work closely across teams as we improve the websites. Here’s a snapshot of some of the major categories of our work over the past year.</p>
<h1><span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #000000;"">Task backlog</span></h1>
<p>In preparing to launch last year, we prioritized must-have features and functionality. We moved the tasks we weren’t able to complete to our backlog list of things to address after cutover. Over the last year, we’ve worked through that list, including:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Filling content gaps</strong>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""2"">Creating and publishing content about savings bonds and Head Start programs in both English and Spanish</li>
<li aria-level=""2"">Designing a <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/es/quejas""><span>complaints section for USAGov en Español</span></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Discoverability of USAGov content</strong>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""2"">Writing custom metadata for each page</li>
<li aria-level=""2"">Enabling automatic sitemap generation for commercial search engines</li>
<li aria-level=""2"">Implementing FAQ schema to allow USAGov content to appear directly on search engine results pages</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Technical updates</strong>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""2"">Upgrading our open source web Content Management System (CMS) and text editor instances</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #000000;"">Addressing user feedback</span></h1>
<p>Usability tests, visitor comments, and click behavior have provided valuable feedback and revealed unmet needs. For example, our <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials""><span>contact elected officials tool</span></a> was the only way on our site that users could get contact information for their representatives. While many users succeeded in this task, data showed that a significant number of users didn’t want to provide their home addresses to find elected officials. Others shared that they wanted the contact information for an elected official outside of their district. In response, we offered alternative means to meet those needs. We’ve also taken steps to validate users' addresses so the tool returns valid results and added headers and descriptors to make it easier to find a specific official.</p>
<p>We also learned from usability tests that searching for an agency name in our <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/agency-index""><span>federal directory records</span> could be confusing</a>. When they searched, participants expected the agency name and information to appear right in the federal directory section. Instead, they were directed to a list of search results on a page outside that section. We used this feedback to redesign the journey. We implemented autofill search that filtered out agency names as a visitor typed, and ultimately only displayed the directory record for their agency of interest directly on our site.</p>
<h1><span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #000000;"">Improved user outcomes</span></h1>
<p>All year long we’ve been collecting metrics measuring visitor satisfaction and task accomplishment. And we’ve been making comparisons between the current and previous versions of the websites. Normally, these metrics don’t have significant shifts quarter over a quarter or even within a year. However, both USA.gov and USAGov en Español have enjoyed noticeable and sustained increased scores since the relaunch. On a 5-point scale, customer satisfaction among surveyed visitors increased.</p>

When people call and chat with us, they expect clear, reliable information about government benefits and services. Learn how we work with our contractor to deliver exceptional service to the people who get in touch with the<span style=""font-size: 11px;""> <span style=""font-size: 17px;""><a href=""https://www.usa.gov/mission-history"">USAGov program</a> </span></span>and pick up some tips for your program’s contact center.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Comprehensive onboarding</h2>
<p>The onboarding process immerses new hires in the contact center’s culture, values, and processes. During an agent’s first week, trainers educate them on the work of <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/""><span>USA.gov</span></a> and <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/es/""><span>USAGov en Español</span></a> and introduce them to our knowledge base. The agent then moves into a one-week ""nesting phase."" As needs arise during this time, they receive additional floor support and feedback from their supervisors.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Continuous training and development</h2>
<p>A contact center team must prioritize continuous training and development for agents. From advanced technical skills to refined communication techniques, a comprehensive training program ensures the team is always at the top of their game.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""color: #222222;"">We provide ongoing training on specific topics for USAGov agents when there is a decline in performance</span><span style=""font-size: 12px; color: #222222;"">. </span>For example, if we see a decline in customer satisfaction around passports, one of our most popular topics, the team receives coaching on key content and agency information from the State Department Bureau of Consular Affairs.</p>
<h2>Live monitoring, feedback, and quality analysis</h2>
<p>Quality assurance is a crucial part of making sure agents are delivering the information people need. We do this through live monitoring and quality analysis of recorded calls and chats. Live monitoring allows supervisors to provide real-time feedback to guide and redirect agents as they’re serving customers.</p>
<p>Quality analysts conduct rigorous audits of customer interactions, providing detailed feedback to agents highlighting their strengths and areas needing improvement. We identify opportunities for USAGov agents to give customers more accurate and complete information. For example, agents are required to provide the referred government agency’s phone number and hours of operation to a customer. This is considered a complete call. But if an agent provides the government agency’s phone number and does not include the hours of operation listed in the knowledge base, that would be considered an incomplete call. This feedback loop between quality analysts, supervisors, and agents fosters a culture of continuous learning and improvement.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Weekly calibration meetings</h2>
<p>Alignment is important for consistency. Our team schedules weekly calibration meetings to bring together supervisors, quality analysts, and team leaders to review scoring criteria. This ensures uniformity in our quality assessment process and promotes fairness and accuracy in evaluating agent performance. We collaborate with our contractor <span style=""font-size: 10px;"">t</span><span style=""color: #222222;"">o listen to live and recent calls and chat inquiries in English and Spanish.</span><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>During the calibrations, we all provide insight into how we will audit the agents and discuss many different points of view.</p>
<h2>Reports and performance reviews</h2>
<p>We follow best practices by providing comprehensive performance reports to agents each month, offering insights into their performance metrics and areas for development. The reviews we conduct help agents track their progress and set goals for the future.</p>
<p>Our internal quality team prepares a monthly quality performance report with a visual performance graph for a rolling 12 months. We note areas for improvement and rank agents by performance score, making it easy for our contractor to see the bottom performers so they can take action and see the top performers so they can be recognized.</p>
<p>The overall quality is based on established service level agreements (SLAs), key performance indicators (KPIs), and feedback from customers. In our contract, we established that the overall score for interactions must be at least 94. When there is a month where the goal isn’t met, we perform extensive research to understand why and how to improve performance. We also encourage feedback from our contractor and agents on areas of improvement and concern.</p>
<p>By prioritizing training, feedback, and continuous improvement, we’re sharpening the ability of our contact center agents to answer people’s questions accurately and efficiently. In the future, we may share more about how the PX Contact Center is helping USAGov and other government programs connect people with the government information and services they need.</p>

USAGov Blog,How USAGov uses data to improve content,How USAGov uses data to improve content,en,/blog/2024/03/how-usagov-uses-data-to-improve-content,Claire Loxsom,"Content,USAGov",Understand how USAGov uses data like survey and search results to improve English and Spanish content.,2024-03-26 12:27:00,2024-03-26T15:45:14.990Z,"<p><span style=""font-size: 17px;"">Each month USAGov’s content designers spend many hours ensuring that the content on <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/"">USA.gov</a><span style=""color: #000000;""> and </span><a href=""https://www.usa.gov/es/"">USAGov en Español</a> is up-to-date, accurate, and meeting user needs. We do holistic reviews of each topic section based on a rolling calendar with the goal of updating all content at least every 6 months</span>.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">These reviews include fact-checking our content, making sure all the links work, and double-checking that we are using best practices for plain language and accessibility. We also rely heavily on data such as analytic traffic, search queries, and survey comments to identify user pain points and improve our content. The following mini case studies demonstrate how data led to small changes in our content with big impacts for users.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;""><strong>Survey data leads to improved page score for housing content</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">Most content pages on USA.gov and USAGov en Español include a survey at the bottom asking users to rate whether the page was helpful (yes or no response) and an opportunity to leave a comment. A review of housing content in June 2023 showed that our page on <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/housing-voucher-section-8""><span>Section 8 housing choice vouchers</span></a> had a low score for page helpfulness, with only 56% of users saying the page was helpful.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">One of our content designers delved into the associated user comments and found that several users were expressing frustration because they encountered long waiting lists for the housing voucher program. To address this issue, we added two sentences to help users know to expect possible wait lists and better understand why wait lists are common.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">This small change resulted in a dramatic improvement (+16%) for page helpfulness scores in the three months following the change.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;""><strong>Search data improves SEO for Selective Service content</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">Our content team uses&nbsp; search data to make sure our content reflects the keywords and phrases people are using to search and to help improve our rankings in search results. We track the search queries that bring users to our content with tools like Google Search Console and Google Analytics. And we also use Google Trends to discover and compare general search queries outside of our sites.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">When reviewing our section for military and veterans in October 2023, one of our content designers noted that the title of the page “Verify your Selective Service number” did not match the top search terms that bring visitors to our page. A comparison in Google Trends also showed users search on “find” more frequently than “verify” when looking for content in this area.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">We updated the page title to “<a href=""https://www.usa.gov/selective-service-card""><span>Find your Selective Service number</span></a>.” This one-word change resulted in nearly triple the number of search impressions in the three months after it was published. Click-through rates also improved (from 3.5% to 4.9%) with an additional 26,747 visits to the page.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;""><strong>Internal search data shows gap in tax content</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">Looking at searches users complete once they land on our sites can help our content designers identify either information that is difficult for users to find or gaps in our content. When reviewing our Spanish section on taxes last August, one of our bilingual content designers noticed users were searching for information on how to get an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number to file taxes, with the term “ITIN” showing an increase in the number of searches.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">Survey data for this same section also showed that our Spanish language audience was looking for information on ITINs – revealing an important piece of the user journey for those filing taxes without a Social Security number. After proposing a new page, the content designer used other search data (Google Trends, Google search results) to find relevant queries, trending keywords, and the language people typically used.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">The <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/es/solicitar-numero-de-identificacion-personal-del-contribuyente-ITIN""><span>new ITIN page launched in Spanish</span></a> in September (with <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/itin""><span>an English version</span></a> added a few months later). The Spanish page has seen increasing traffic since launch and a large spike in visits at the start of this year’s tax season. It has also shown high user satisfaction with a 96% page helpfulness score since launch.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;""><strong>Continuing to iterate</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">While these case studies show how content changes can result in some dramatic improvements in user data, not every change we make has the same result. For example, an SEO change may bring more traffic to a page, but not always result in higher user satisfaction.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">Our review cycle is a continual opportunity to discover what brings people to our websites, how they feel about the content they find there, and how we can make that content more effective.</p>",https://532040.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/532040/FY24%20-%20Blog-USAGOVData%20%2803.25.24%29.png,,PUBLISHED,false

As key players connecting people to official government information and services, we rooted this effort in our mutual messaging and goals to help guide the public.</span></p>
<!--more-->
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The campaign took place on September 19, 2023, for National Voter Registration Day (NVRD), a national effort encouraging people to register to vote and make a voting plan before Election Day. It occurs annually about six weeks before Election Day — ahead of all state registration deadlines (except North Dakota, which doesn’t require registration before voting).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Partnering with USAGov made sense for vote.gov. We were eager to remind folks to register to vote and update their registration in honor of the national effort, but our vote.gov social media presence is much smaller than USAGov’s. Additionally, this was an opportunity for our newer vote.gov team to work with the established USAGov program’s outreach team staff, their best practices, and established processes on different social media platforms. By partnering with USAGov, vote.gov was able to spread the word to a larger audience across USAGov’s multiple English-language @USAGov platforms (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/USAGov/""><span>Facebook</span></a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/usagov""><span>Instagram</span></a>, and <a href=""https://x.com/usagov""><span>X</span></a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had two main goals for the social media takeover:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Answer common questions from the public about voting and how to register to vote</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Raise awareness about vote.gov on USAGov’s social media platforms where vote.gov doesn’t have a presence</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key impacts</strong></p>
<p>The partnership was successful and offered a model for future social media takeovers and partnerships between federal agencies and teams. Across the three @USAGov social media channels, we reached an audience of 36,000 people with about 2,000 engagements on the day-long takeover. We saw the largest reach and engagement on Instagram. It was an opportunity to create a vote.gov presence on the growing and visually-driven platform.</p>

<p>Even in an ""off"" election year, without a presidential or midterm election in 2023, the enthusiasm for voter registration was palpable. Several organizations and influencers from diverse backgrounds tagged vote.gov in their social media posts, encouraging people to visit us to get more registration information. This included U.S. senators, the <a href=""https://twitter.com/SecGranholm/status/1704167952923124197""><span>secretary of the Department of Energy</span></a>, sports teams like the <a href=""https://m.facebook.com/NYKnicks/photos/a.71815779615/10163363696154616/?type=3&amp;source=57""><span>NY Knicks</span></a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/NYRangers/status/1704236421328883991""><span>NY Rangers</span></a>, the <a href=""https://twitter.com/ChicagoMuseum/status/1704167707753472325""><span>Chicago History Museum</span></a>, actress <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CxYvULsylfD/?hl=en""><span>Jennifer Lewis's gospel choir</span></a>, and many more. We also saw particularly high engagement from messaging about the multilingual content on vote.gov, which is available in 17 languages.</p>
<p>Traffic to vote.gov jumped from an average of around 5,000 daily visitors during the rest of September 2023 to more than 42,000 visitors on NVRD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internally, this partnership created a testing ground for outreach efforts between vote.gov and USAGov, which are part of the same larger organization. And it affirmed the potential for future resource sharing and collaboration. We learned more about each other’s processes, campaign styles, and what is valuable when engaging with the public.</p>
<p><strong>Future plans</strong></p>
<p>There is clearly interest in and enthusiasm for vote.gov across social media platforms, and we’re working to expand <a href=""https://www.x.com/votegov""><span>@VoteGov</span></a> to more platforms in time for the 2024 presidential election.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re planning to spread the word about voter registration again on NVRD this year and are considering also posting in non-English languages to make sure that people who have limited English proficiency (LEP) know that vote.gov is available in several languages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vote.gov looks forward to collaborating more with <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/""><span>USA.gov</span></a>, <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/es/""><span>USAGov en Español</span></a>, and federal agency partners to amplify voting information throughout the presidential election year.</p>

USAGov Blog,Designing with empathy,Designing with empathy,en,/blog/2024/01/designing-with-empathy,Claire Loxsom,"Design and Development,USAGov,User Experience and Accessibility",The USAGov benefit finder team created the latest version of the tool with empathy. Discover the ways we used empathy to create a more effective product.,2024-01-25 11:45:00,2024-01-25T15:12:20.746Z,"<p>Empathy was one of the guiding principles we used when we created the <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/benefit-finder""><span>new version of USAGov’s benefit finder</span></a>. We believe that in addition to being a critical component of human-centered design, empathy is essential for our product. People who are applying for federal benefits may be going through a difficult life situation. If we can’t empathize and fail to offer a product that understands and meets people where they are, we might lose the opportunity to provide the practical support they need.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We incorporated empathy into the benefit finder development process from ideation to launch. And we kept in mind that we were working with two different cultural contexts as we designed the benefit finder in English and Spanish. Here are some ways we used empathy to create a more effective, impactful, and useful product.</p>
<h2>Empathizing with specific situations</h2>
<p>USAGov’s benefit finder currently focuses on helping people find benefits when dealing with three major life events: <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/benefit-finder/death""><span>death of a loved one</span></a>, <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/benefit-finder/disability"" rel=""noopener""><span>disability</span></a>, and <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/benefit-finder/retirement"" rel=""noopener""><span>retirement</span></a>. The complexities and nuance of dealing with the death of a loved one made it a natural but challenging choice to begin our journey of empathetic design.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4119479/""><span>Several medical studies</span></a> found that people experiencing loss have a more challenging time processing and digesting information. To address this, we performed our own research and conducted user tests with English and Spanish speakers who had recently lost a loved one. By taking a transcreative approach, we were able to see how different language and cultural contexts influenced the way people perceived, understood, and used the application. The findings helped us get authentic feedback and better understand the surviving family members’ priorities.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Keep it simple</h2>
<p>The results of our user testing also strengthened our resolve to keep only the most essential information and make the benefit finder as easy as possible to understand and use. Government language around benefits can be hard to grasp, especially for someone under duress. So we simplified the benefit eligibility form by reducing the amount of mental processing a user would have to do. We followed plain language standards to help us make the form easy to complete for someone experiencing high stress, grief, and competing priorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We decreased the character count and sentence length on the pages and deleted repetitive words and statements like “you may be eligible.” This helped us cut the text significantly without losing the purpose of the tool and contributed to a more accessible experience.</p>
<h2>Shift accessibility left</h2>
<p>Shifting accessibility left simply means to include accessibility needs and considerations at the beginning of the product’s design process instead of at the end. Our accessibility specialists were active and engaged from the start. By putting an early focus on accessibility, the benefit finder tool avoided common accessibility compliance issues leading up to launch. This strategy also saved valuable development time by avoiding the need to rewrite code for compliance later in the development cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Use universal design</h2>
<p>As part of our drive to shift left, we wanted to make sure the benefit finder was accessible and usable by everyone according to universal design principles. Defined as ""the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability,"" <a href=""https://www.section508.gov/blog/Universal-Design-What-is-it/""><span>universal design</span></a> is a cornerstone of accessibility. These are some ways we used universal design to increase empathy:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">By making the form short, straightforward, and accessible, we also made it more equitable. Regardless of age, disability, education, or life situation, anyone could use the form quickly and successfully, with or without assistive technology.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">We reduced the time and physical and cognitive effort required so people could quickly get what they were looking for. Our research showed users could complete the form and start applying for benefits in just a few minutes.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">We decreased the probability of errors and false positives by reducing the potential for questions to be left blank or answered incorrectly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mobile-first approach</h2>
<p>Understanding that most users will access the tool on mobile devices, we followed a mobile-first approach and reduced the overall size and length of the application. We prioritized the mobile experience by adapting the desktop version from the mobile design. Only after having thoroughly tested, researched, and modified the mobile design did we design the desktop version. This approach ensured that mobile usability and user interface (UI) were prioritized in line with the needs of future users as people will increasingly choose mobile over desktop access to the tool.</p>
<h2>Make it intuitive</h2>
<p>In the previous version of our benefit finder, people answered questions in a multi-panel, single-page format. We changed this by shifting from an open single-page form in which users saw results as they answered questions, to a multi-page progressive form, which also follows <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/multi-page/""><span>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</span></a>. In the multi-page format, users first answer questions before receiving a personalized list of eligibility results on a separate page. By creating a sequential flow, we reduced the cognitive burden on users while improving their focus on the results.</p>
<h2>Increase engagement</h2>
<p>For many, filling out forms feels like a burdensome use of their time. Our research found that people sometimes race to finish a form, leading to missed questions. To encourage greater engagement, we reduced the overall number of questions, bundling some together and eliminating others. And we moved the highest-impact questions to appear earlier in the form. This helped ensure that the most important questions didn’t get missed.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Encourage accuracy</h2>
<p>We redesigned the benefit finder form to return more accurate results. We implemented “yes or no” formatted questions instead of an open-ended approach. And we made a few key questions required while allowing less important questions to be optional. This would allow the form to provide a more complete list of results with less information. We let users know on the start page that the more questions they responded to, the more accurate the results would be. But people could still retain the option to leave some questions unanswered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Designing the updated benefit finder tool challenged us to put empathy at the forefront of the process. As we introduce new features and content, we will continue the ongoing journey to create a product that will be more useful to the people it serves.</p>",https://532040.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/532040/FY24%20Blog%20Cover_Designing_With_Empathy_%2801.12.24%29-1.png,,PUBLISHED,false

<!--more-->
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">Accessibility testing is the evaluation of a digital product or service to ensure that people with disabilities can use it. This includes those with visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. And it’s for anyone who uses assistive technologies to access the internet. For example, a person with a visual disability may need to use a screen reader to read the content on a website to them. Or a person with a physical disability may need to navigate a website using only a keyboard if they can’t use a mouse.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">Accessibility testing is important because it helps to ensure that everyone has equal access to digital products and services. It also helps to create a more inclusive and equitable society.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">There are different ways to go about accessibility testing. Some of the most common methods include:</p>
<ul style=""font-size: 17px;"">
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Manual testing</strong>: using the product or service with a variety of assistive technologies, such as screen readers, screen magnifiers, and voice input software</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Automated testing</strong>: using automated tools to scan the product or service for potential accessibility issues</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>User testing</strong>: having people with disabilities test the product or service and provide feedback on their experience</li>
</ul>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">Here are some tips we’ve learned for effective accessibility testing:</p>
<ul style=""font-size: 17px;"">
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Start early.</strong> Integrate accessibility testing into the development process. Don’t perform it as an afterthought. This will help to identify accessibility issues early on when they are less expensive and time-consuming to fix.</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Include a variety of testing methods. </strong>Use a combination of manual testing, automated testing, and user testing. Manual testing is necessary for identifying complex accessibility issues. Automated testing can be used to quickly scan for common issues.</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Involve people with disabilities.</strong> People with disabilities are the accessibility experts. Involve them in the testing process to get accurate and valuable real-world feedback.</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Use accessibility guidelines.</strong> &nbsp;<span>See the&nbsp;</span><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/"" target=""_blank"" data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1705102877122000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1nPEbTym593iQNOJsH7Cde"" rel=""noopener""><span><span style=""color: #3574e3;"">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

Now <a href=""http://www.search.gov/""><span style=""color: #3574e3;"">Search.gov</span></a> is offering the same flexibility to federal websites, giving their users control over the amount of detail they get in their search results.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 style=""font-size: 17px;"">What are search filters?</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">Imagine you are shopping at an online store for some new shoes. You get a set of results that’s too large. You look over the filtering options on the side of the screen, and decide you only want to see matches for a certain size or style. You check some boxes, and the search results narrow down to only those that match your selections. These filters make the search experience easier.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">“Facets” is the technical term for the metadata structure behind these filters. (Metadata is a set of data that gives information about other data.) Instead of calling it “faceted search,” we call this feature “search filters” in the Search.gov system because it’s easier to understand.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;""><img src=""https://532040.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/532040/Example%20of%20search%20filters%20for%20language%20selection%20on%20search.epa.gov..png"" width=""283"" height=""512"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Example of search filters for language selection on search.epa.gov."" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 283px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></p>
<p style=""font-size: 14px;""><strong><em>Caption: </em></strong><em>Example of search filters for language selection on search.epa.gov.</em></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 17px;"">Why use search filters?</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">Most of Search.gov’s service and system improvements are the result of communication and outreach efforts to gather meaningful feedback from our customers. They share with us their search needs, which are ultimately the needs of the public.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">Though search filters are a regular part of e-commerce search experiences, they are not present on commercial web search engines. After years of talking about search filters with our customers, we hosted a couple of focus groups that helped us determine that they definitely wanted and needed this feature for their websites. How to make it happen was the question.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">Search engines require access to metadata from websites to use as part of the search experience. Some common metadata elements like title, description, and date are usually included in website templates, and these are important components of commercial web search engine optimization (SEO). But keywords have fallen out of use on websites as commercial search engines started ignoring them when too many sites practiced “keyword stuffing”--the misuse or overuse of keywords to increase SEO. This lack of keywords creates gaps in the descriptive metadata for a website and makes things like filtering by topic impossible for search engines.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">Meanwhile, even though keywords are not used by commercial search engines, agency website managers have developed robust keyword strategies for tracking their content internally within their content management systems (CMS). Search experiences powered by the content management systems themselves can offer this filtering. But content management systems can only search within their own databases, similar to an e-commerce site’s database of products for sale. Web search engines like Search.gov sit outside. They can search on individual websites and across multiple websites but can’t access the valuable keyword tags and other descriptive metadata that websites don’t publish and make available to search engines.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">Because it was clear that our agency partners had this rich metadata and wanted their searchers to be able to use it, we created <a href=""https://search.gov/indexing/metadata.html""><span style=""color: #3574e3;"">a metadata structure</span></a> that could allow them to publish that information using standard tagging schemas, while also sharing some metadata specifically with Search.gov in a set of custom tags. This allows our system to gain visibility into the website’s internal metadata, and make it available to searchers as filters. We’re proud to have developed a one-of-a-kind solution that combines the best of external and internal search tools in one service.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 17px;"">A case study: how NASA uses search filters</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">Around the time President Biden signed the <span style=""color: #3574e3;""><a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/13/executive-order-on-transforming-federal-customer-experience-and-service-delivery-to-rebuild-trust-in-government/"" style=""color: #3574e3;"">Executive Order on <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government</span></a></span> calling for federal agencies to make it easier for people to use government services and programs, NASA began modernizing its flagship website. One of the most important goals of the new <span style=""color: #3574e3;""><a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/"" style=""color: #3574e3;"">NASA.gov</a></span> design is to improve the web experience for a wide range of visitors, from students to scientists and everyone in between. And site search is a key component of these ongoing improvements.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">In addition to making meaningful changes to the website’s content and structure, the NASA web team decided to integrate Search.gov’s search filtering feature into their new site to support their visitors’ search journey. Our teams worked together and had discussions ranging from content management systems and SEO to strategy and governance for metadata. NASA has plans for future improvements to their site search, but Search.gov’s search filters were critical to achieving their initial goals for the new site’s public launch in late September 2023.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">To power NASA’s new search experience spanning multiple redesigned sites (<span style=""color: #3574e3;""><a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/"" style=""color: #3574e3;"">www.nasa.gov</a></span>, <span style=""color: #3574e3;""><a href=""https://science.nasa.gov/"" style=""color: #3574e3;"">science.nasa.gov</a></span>, <a href=""https://ciencia.nasa.gov/""><span style=""color: #3574e3;"">ciencia.nasa.gov</span></a> and <span style=""color: #3574e3;""><a href=""https://plus.nasa.gov/"" style=""color: #3574e3;"">plus.nasa.gov</a></span>), NASA is publishing metadata in both standard and custom tags to share with us. This allows visitors to filter results by content type, category and language, with more to come. Now, when you search NASA.gov for a topic such as “mercury,” you can narrow your search results using different filter options that make it easier to find what you’re looking for, whether it’s the planet or the mission. <span style=""color: #3574e3;""><a href=""https://www.nasa.gov/?search=mercury"" style=""color: #3574e3;"">Take a look!</a></span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 17px;"">What’s Next</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">Our team is very excited to add this long-awaited capability to our list of features. Our main goal is to improve the search experience for visitors using government websites and encourage federal agencies to learn more about the many advantages of using Search.gov.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">Currently, search filters are available to our customers using our <a href=""https://open.gsa.gov/api/searchgov-results/""><span style=""color: #3574e3;"">Results API</span></a>, and in the coming months, it will be available for customers using our hosted search results page. Looking ahead, we hope to work with our agency partners to use this valuable metadata to improve search result ranking and relevance. In addition, we are actively listening to see what other kinds of filters we could add that would create additional value and new ways for people to find what they need.</p>

<p>As a bilingual program, USAGov aims to give our English and Spanish-language audiences the information they want in the cultural context they need. This is why we focus on the concept of transcreation in our everyday work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A combination of the words “translation” and “creation,” transcreation is the practice of writing a message that:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Carries the same implications in both languages</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Elicits the same emotions in the new language as in the original language</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Considers differences in culture and what resonates with the target audience&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Transcreation actively involves cultural sensitivity and adds a human touch that automated translators can’t. It also prevents literal or unshaped translations that can be confusing. However, the process comes with its challenges. Relying on team members to transcreate takes time and effort that online translation tools don’t need. And languages like Spanish vary by region, so content writers from different regions are influenced by different grammar rules, colloquialisms, and other factors. To keep our transcreation work consistent, we use bilingual glossaries, dictionaries, and style guides.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the main things we’ve learned when transcreating messaging through our USAGov and USAGov en Español outreach channels:</p>
<p><strong>Analyze early and often with your team. </strong>With a broad scope of information to cover, user-generated data is at the forefront of our bilingual content development. Each week, our outreach team meets to analyze and discuss trending topics and review reports from our weekly social media channels, email, website, and contact center to create our bilingual editorial calendar. This allows us to cross-connect our channels and determine what people are looking for in English and in Spanish. It minimizes assumptions, helps us be culturally sensitive, and helps us understand our audiences better.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Use channel and language-specific data to help drive direction. </strong>Our content development process relies on consistently checking our resources and listening actively to our data. For example, this summer, we saw a lot of site search terms around travel documents. In English, the focus was on passports while in Spanish, we saw more visa-related terms like “I-94” forms and visas. So, instead of forcing a single topic on both the @USAGov and the @USAGovEspanol channels, we adjusted the messaging to deliver what each audience was looking for.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""https://532040.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/532040/FY24%20Multilingual%20Blog%20(10.24.23)Blog%20asset.png"" width=""620"" height=""309"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Two recent social media posts - one English (left), one Spanish (right) - that exemplify data-driven travel topics and differences in user needs in each language."" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 620px;""></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><em>Caption:</em></span><strong><em> </em></strong><em>Two recent social media posts - one English (left), one Spanish (right) - that exemplify data-driven travel topics and differences in user needs in each language.</em></p>
<p><strong>Transcreation is a two-way street. </strong>One of the benefits of thinking across languages is considering the intersection between audience needs and the resources we want to link to. During our weekly brainstorms, we ask questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Are the materials we want to share available in both languages?</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">What terms are people using to search for information on a particular topic?</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Is this content angle relevant to this audience?</li>
</ul>
<p>How we transcreate content might be affected by the availability of information in a particular language or how we talk about certain topics. As a result, transcreation doesn’t only have to be from English to Spanish, but can also be from Spanish to English and does not have to be a perfect one-to-one match.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considering when and how to start or maintain a multilingual strategy can be challenging.<span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>We’ve learned that if you approach the transcreation process with empathy, data analysis, and flexibility, you have the potential to create a positive digital experience for anyone connecting with their government. The USAGov team will continue to improve access to services and information in all of our outreach efforts for our Spanish-speaking audience and people with limited English proficiency.</p>

See what we learned from the recent usability testing on our scams wizard.,2023-10-04 19:25:13,2023-10-04T19:25:13.462Z,"<p>USAGov works to make it easier to find and understand government benefits, programs, and information.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more--><p>People often come to us wanting to report scams but don’t know which kind of scam should be reported to which agency. And many experience emotional harm as a result of being scammed. USAGov’s usability (UX) team kept this in mind as we developed a pared-down process for our visitors to easily report a scam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We decided that a wizard would work best and created <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/where-report-scams"" style=""color: #4a6ee0;"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span><span style=""color: #3574e3;"">a version in English for USA.gov</span></span></a> and <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/es/donde-reportar-una-estafa"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span><span style=""color: #3574e3;"">a version in Spanish for USAGov en Español</span></span></a>. The tool offers a step-by-step process that allows visitors to answer a few simple questions to find out where and how to report the scam they experienced.</p>
<p>We recently performed usability testing on both versions of the wizard, with the goals of:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Learning if our visitors could navigate a page without any difficulties and find the information they were looking for</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Seeing if the tool could answer real-world questions</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Confirming whether the wizard was the best approach for this kind of sensitive content</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are 5 things we learned through testing:&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>1. Reporting a scam can be stressful.</strong></h2>
<p>Due to the sense of urgency and sensitive nature of reporting a scam, test participants vocalized how stressful it was not knowing how long the reporting process would take. By moving from our old websites’ text-heavy scam information to our new sites’ wizard tool, we found that less wording and a clearer path made participants feel calmer and<strong> </strong>more<strong> </strong>confident.</p>
<h2><strong>2. The terms “identity theft” and “impostor” were confusing.</strong></h2>
<p>Identity theft happens when someone gets and uses another person's personal data through fraud or deception, typically for financial gain. An impostor is a person who pretends to be someone else to deceive others. Since the two terms seem similar, these two options were confusing to most of our participants.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Participants were looking for the words “online,” “internet,” or “text message.”</strong></h2>
<p>Rather than asking for help for specific types of scams, many participants asked for help according to where the scam took place, such as by text or online. To make reporting easier, we’re considering adding an initial page to the wizard to give people the option of finding help according to where a scam took place: online, by phone, text, mail, or some other way.</p>
<h2><strong>4. We initially had difficulty recruiting Spanish-speaking participants.</strong></h2>
<p>We noticed this study was not as popular among our Spanish-speaking audience members. But, it was important to test the tool with Spanish speakers because <a href=""https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2022/09/lets-talk-about-scams-target-latinos"" style=""color: #4a6ee0;""><span>Latino communities are often hit by scams</span></a> involving immigration and work-from-home opportunities. After further research, we translated the screener from English to Spanish to attract Spanish-speaking <span style=""color: #000000;"">participants</span>. And we switched out the word “estafas” (scams) for “fraudes” (fraud) once we saw that “fraudes” was the more popular search term used by our Spanish-speaking audience.</p>
<h2><strong>5. Participants wanted each scam category to be more descriptive.&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>The most confusing categories for participants were identity theft, imposter scams, and romance or catfishing scams. Because not all of our participants were familiar with the scam categories we used, many said it would be helpful to add a description to each category.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re planning more research and improvements for our scams wizard based on the feedback we received from our usability testing participants. We’ll start with a card sort to help us make labels more understandable. Then we’ll take what we learned and create a prototype with improvements and features to test with more participants before we do further development.</p>

USAGov Blog,6 lessons from a project handoff,6 lessons from a project handoff,en,/blog/2023/09/6-lessons-from-a-project-handoff,Angelica Perez,"Design and Development,USAGov,User Experience and Accessibility",Project handoffs are not simple as they include some risks. See the 6 lessons the USAGov and 10x teams learned as the benefit locator tool changed hands.,2023-09-19 15:00:00,2023-09-19T15:00:00.531Z,"<p>Project handoffs are not simple. Teams have their own cultures and work styles. Without planning, a project could lose institutional memory, time, quality, and funding when it passes from one team to the next.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more--><p><span style=""color: #3574e3;""><a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/helping-people-discover-benefits-with-the-new-bears-locator"" style=""color: #3574e3;"">Last year USAGov received a benefit locator as an MVP (minimum viable product) from 10x</a></span>, GSA’s crowdsource incubator. By planning with 10x, and preparing for the eventuality of the transition between teams, we were all able to mitigate many of the risks involved in a product handoff. Here are 6 lessons we learned as the benefit locator project changed hands:&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>1. Time the entrance</strong></h2>
<p>It’s important to schedule your handoff window in advance so the incoming and outgoing teams can prepare for the off- and onboarding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot of planning went into the benefit locator handoff and the actions that had to come before it. From the start, 10x's goal was to develop the locator only as far as an MVP and then pass it to our USAGov team for further development and scaling. Knowing this ahead of time prepared both teams for the shift. They were able to define critical considerations like the statement of work for the new team, the funding requirements, and the necessary approvals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important too for both teams to be realistic when setting schedule expectations. For example, if an outgoing team doesn’t have enough time to complete the established requirements for turnover, the incoming team might have extra work to do. This can add undue pressure, rush the onboarding process, and lose time.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>2. Anticipate time lags</strong></h2>
<p>Because of the duration of the procurement process, there was a gap of about five months from the time 10x completed the MVP to the time USAGov's product manager arrived and began the new team's onboarding. The 10x and USAGov teams anticipated this gap and allocated 10x's time and resources at a minimum to focus on maintenance and service rather than active development during this time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having a stable MVP in place during this period allowed the public to use a functioning product while the transition and onboarding took place.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>3. Pace and stagger the onboarding</strong></h2>
<p>10x built a small but robust product with a lean and experienced team, but scaling that product required the new team to grow accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pacing and staggering onboarding worked well for the inbound team. The USAGov team was able to ramp up the work gradually, onboarding contractors in several small groups. This provided an opportunity to create a repeatable onboarding cycle, which helped the team connect and settle into their work. It also helped avoid the chaos and disorganization that can sometimes follow large-scale onboarding efforts.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Establish a culture of documenting</strong></h2>
<p>The 10x and USAGov teams developed a culture of documenting work throughout the product's lifecycle. The 10x team documented the benefit locator’s creation and its progress through the 10x program's<span> </span><a href=""https://10x.gsa.gov/process/""><span style=""color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;"">four-phase research and development process</span></a>. This helped USAGov’s team lead, members, and stakeholders know how the locator began and grew. And it gave us an understanding of how to continue building the product.</p>
<p>The 10x team recognized that their documentation fit their specific work culture. When the time came for the handoff, they prepared and reframed the information so it would be more accessible for our incoming USAGov team. 10x created a centralized ‘shortcut document’ with links to about 50 other documents related to the project. Used as a kind of table of contents for the project, it made onboarding the new team easier. It also created continuity for the institutional memory of the product.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>5. Discover &amp; prioritize where you are going</strong></h2>
<p>When we received the benefit locator documentation from the 10x team, we made a discovery assessment and began adapting it to our USAGov team style and culture. Our exploratory deep dive helped us understand how the product was built--what technical and user experience decisions went into its creation. It helped us develop a vision for the next version of the product.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>6. Communication, communication, communication</strong></h2>
<p>Regardless of thorough documentation, planning, and structuring, teams are made of humans. The products being built may be digital and technical, but the people and teams building them aren’t. So it was important to keep open and active communication throughout the handoff within and between teams. We requested more support hours from the 10x team than we thought we might need. This allowed our team to reach out to 10x freely, avoiding guesswork and saving time in the long run. It also gave 10x a chance to set their expectations for how engaged they would be post-handoff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no perfect way to execute a project handoff. But whether it’s anticipated or unexpected, whole or partial, the more thought and communication the outgoing and incoming teams can invest, the better-prepared everyone will be to carry the project forward.</p>",https://532040.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/532040/FY23%20Blog%289.18.23%29BEARS%202%20blog%20cover.png,,PUBLISHED,false
USAGov Blog,Making the case for sentence case on USAGov’s websites,Making the case for sentence case on USAGov’s websites,en,/blog/2023/09/making-the-case-for-sentence-case,Angelica Perez,"Content,Design and Development,Multilingual,USAGov,User Experience and Accessibility","What is the best case style to use for titles and headings? For the new USAGov websites, we discuss the decision to use sentence case on USAGov products.",2023-09-05 15:00:00,2025-01-16T15:24:39.602Z,"<p>When creating content for our newly reimagined websites, the USAGov content team spent many hours researching topics, analyzing data, and writing user-friendly copy. We also spent a fair bit of time thinking through one small, but impactful detail: <strong><em>What is the best case style to use for titles and headings?</em></strong></p>
<!--more-->
<p>A simple Google search for sentence case vs. title case reveals more than 400 million results, with no clear indication of which one provides the optimal user experience. <span style=""color: #102d7b;""><a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20230209010528/https://www.usa.gov/"" style=""color: #102d7b;"">The previous version of the English USA.gov website</a></span> used title case (Capitalizing Every Major Word in the Title), while <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20230128100054/https://www.usa.gov/espanol/""><span><span style=""color: #102d7b;"">the earlier version of our Spanish-language site, USAGov en Español</span></span></a>, used sentence case (Only capitalizing the first word and proper names).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had a general sense that using sentence case was more conversational and on trend for modern websites. But we wanted to do a deeper analysis of the trade-offs before making our decision. We gathered information from a number of blog posts, journal articles, and style guides. We also studied accessibility recommendations and examined how our own customer data fit with what we were learning.</p>
<h2><strong>Audience age</strong></h2>
<p>One question we considered is what casing style might be most familiar to our audience. Older users tend to be more accustomed to title case on websites, while millennials and younger users may be more accustomed to sentence case from commercial websites and social media.</p>
<p>Analytic data showed that 63% of the users on USA.gov are aged 18-44, which gave a slight edge to possibly using sentence case.</p>
<h2><strong>Geographical location and languages</strong></h2>
<p>School children in the United States often have title case drilled into them during English class. But as this <span style=""color: #102d7b;""><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/title-case-vs-sentence-case-in-ux-writing-212087192261"" style=""color: #102d7b;"">UX design blog post</a></span> points out, title case is rarely used in the rest of the world. About 14% of our English-language audience comes from outside the U.S.</p>
<p><span>Title case is rarely used for languages besides English. In Spanish, sentence case is grammatically correct, so we would continue to use it for USAGov en Español</span>. We also knew that about <span style=""color: #102d7b;""><a href=""https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2022/acs/acs-50.html"" style=""color: #102d7b;"">20% of the U.S. population speaks languages other than English</a></span> at home.</p>
<h2><strong>Readability</strong></h2>
<p>We hoped to find a definitive answer to whether sentence case or title case is easier to read, but the opinions on that front appeared to be mixed. One thing was clear: bigger is better. A <span style=""color: #102d7b;""><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2016788/"" style=""color: #102d7b;"">research study on text legibility</a></span> notes an advantage for title case and upper-case letters as they appear larger and easier to read for people with low vision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, sentence case may make sense for longer strings of text. As this <span style=""color: #102d7b;""><a href=""https://uxplanet.org/why-letter-casing-is-important-to-consider-during-design-decisions-50402acd0a4e"" style=""color: #102d7b;"">UX Planet blog points out</a></span>, eliminating capital letters can make it easier for users to skim over longer-form text. In many cases, these longer strings of text might be partial or complete sentences where sentence case would read as more grammatically correct to users.</p>
<h2><strong>Accessibility</strong></h2>
<p>Like readability, we could not find a definitive answer on whether title case or sentence case would be more accessible. Our accessibility expert confirmed that screen readers would announce either style properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While title case may be slightly more accessible for people with low vision, we found one scientific review that recommends <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347481260_A_Comparative_Study_of_Dyslexia_Style_Guides_in_Improving_Readability_for_People_With_Dyslexia""><span><span style=""color: #102d7b;"">avoiding title case for readers with dyslexia</span></span></a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Voice and tone&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>USAGov websites aim to be both friendly and authoritative. We were already using active voice and writing in the second person (you/your) in our web copy. Sentence case seemed like a natural fit with this more conversational style.</p>
<h2><strong>Credibility</strong></h2>
<p>Probably the stickiest point in our internal debates about style was whether sentence case might be too casual for maintaining our authority as a government website. Our audience may be used to seeing title case on government websites and we certainly didn’t want to detract from our overall credibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, our user testing indicated that there are other elements that users rely on to evaluate the trustworthiness of our site such as the .gov domain and our banner identifying us as an official government website.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Consistency</strong></h2>
<p>While many government websites use title case–80% of the federal-level websites we looked at–there were some prominent redesigns in 2022 and 2023. Sites such as <span style=""color: #102d7b;""><a href=""https://www.ssa.gov/"" style=""color: #102d7b;"">SSA.gov</a></span>, <span style=""color: #102d7b;""><a href=""https://www.va.gov/"" style=""color: #102d7b;"">VA.gov</a></span>, <a href=""https://digital.gov/style-guide/""><span><span style=""color: #102d7b;"">Digital.gov</span></span></a>, and <a href=""http://www.gsa.gov"" rel=""noopener"">GSA.gov</a> have begun adopting sentence case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These sites, like our own sites, incorporate the <a href=""https://designsystem.digital.gov/""><span>U<span style=""color: #102d7b;"">.S. Web Design System (USWDS)</span></span></a>, which provides design patterns and components for federal government websites. While USWDS does not provide specific guidance on how to capitalize headings, their latest templates do use sentence case for page titles, headings, and buttons. Our assumption is that more of the government web content we link to from USAGov’s sites may be adopting sentence case in the coming years.</p>
<p>We also reached out to some other agencies for feedback on why they adopted sentence case and heard about benefits such as making their content easier to read, consistency with other guidelines, and that it was easier for content designers to apply consistently.</p>
<h2><strong>Evaluating our content</strong></h2>
<p>After weighing all the different factors from our research, many of our team members were leaning toward sentence case, but a crucial part of our decision was also evaluating our own content. We used the website crawler Screaming Frog to analyze the different headings used on our new sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""https://532040.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/532040/FY23%20Sentence%20case%20blog%20(8.30.23)TC%20vs%20SC-1.png"" width=""1793"" height=""1133"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Comparison of a USA.gov page title using title case (left) and sentence case (right) on a small screen. In some cases, moving to sentence case reduced the number of lines titles and headings wrapped to for our mobile users."" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 1793px;""><span style=""font-size: 14px;""><em><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Caption: </span><span style=""color: #000000;"">Comparison of a USA.gov page title using title case (left) and sentence case (right) on a small screen. In some cases, moving to sentence case reduced the number of lines that titles and headings wrapped to for our mobile users.</span></em></span></p>
<p>Overall, both page titles and headings were trending longer on the new sites as we had worked to include more keywords in our content to optimize for search engines. Our analysis showed that almost 60% of page titles and 77% of our H2 level headings were longer than 30 characters, in many cases wrapping to at least three lines on small screen displays.<span style=""font-size: 14px;""><span style=""color: #000000;""></span></span></p>
<p>We took into consideration the wording used in these headings as well, with 65% of our H2 headings appearing to be full sentences. This made sentence case seem the most natural.<span style=""font-size: 14px;""><span style=""color: #000000;""></span></span></p>
<h2><strong>Embracing sentence case</strong><span style=""font-size: 14px;""><span style=""color: #000000;""></span></span></h2>
<p>After all of our research and reflection, we decided to switch all content on our new English beta website to sentence case before it launched to the public. We created some brief guidelines for our team of content designers, split up our nearly 400 pages, and systematically made the change over a few weeks.<span style=""font-size: 14px;""><span style=""color: #000000;""></span></span></p>
<p>We didn’t see any red flags with the new style during our six-month beta period or in the time since the beta sites became the new <span style=""color: #102d7b;""><a href=""https://www.usa.gov/"" style=""color: #102d7b;"">USA.gov</a></span> and <span style=""color: #102d7b;""><a href=""https://www.usa.gov/es/"" style=""color: #102d7b;"">USAGov en Español</a></span> in April 2023. Our web surveys show no change in the overall rating for the trustworthiness of the sites. The new style has been easy for our content designers to apply consistently and we’ve begun introducing sentence case to our other channels including social media, email outreach, and this blog.<span style=""font-size: 14px;""><span style=""color: #000000;""></span></span></p>

Read more about the new features available!,2023-08-08 15:00:00,2023-08-08T15:00:02.218Z,"<p>In 2022, USAGov launched a government benefits locator tool. It was created following extensive research on how to help people find benefits for specific life events. The tool is available in English and Spanish and started with one life event, the <span style=""color: #3574e3;""><a href=""https://benefits-tool.usa.gov/death-of-a-loved-one/?"" style=""color: #3574e3;"">death of a loved one</a></span>, to find survivor benefits after losing someone close. By answering a few questions, people can learn about as many as 33 survivor benefits from seven government agencies that they might qualify for.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Recently, we launched some important additions to the tool, including two new life events. One helps people approaching retirement. The other helps people dealing with disability or illness. We chose these events because multiple agencies offer many benefits for them, and these events touch the lives of a large part of the population. A majority of people working in the U.S. will retire. And as many as <span style=""color: #3574e3;""><a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html"" style=""color: #3574e3;"">one in four adults in the U.S. have a disability</a></span>. Many others will experience a short-term disability in their lifetime.</p>

<h2><strong>Approaching retirement</strong></h2>
<p>Retirement can be daunting. There are many things to plan during this important transition, and government benefits can help with health care, retirement income, and other needs and costs of this new phase of life. The <span style=""color: #3574e3;""><a href=""https://benefits-tool.usa.gov/retirement/?"" style=""color: #3574e3;"">retirement benefits locator</a></span> contains 18 benefits offered by seven agencies. When a person answers some basic questions, the tool filters a tailored list of retirement benefits they may qualify to receive.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Disability</strong></h2>
<p>For people living with a disability or an illness, the <span style=""color: #3574e3;""><a href=""https://benefits-tool.usa.gov/disability/?"" style=""color: #3574e3;"">disability benefits locator</a></span> with 22 benefits from nine agencies can help. Whether someone has a short- or long-term disability or illness, this tool makes it easy to find benefits to help with medical care, basic living expenses, finding a job, and more.</p>
<h2><strong>Other benefits locator updates</strong></h2>
<p>We also created other modifications based on user research, including making the content more empathetic and conversational. We added a subheading acknowledging the importance of life events and the tool's purpose. We included an introduction for each life event that empathizes with users going through that event. And we simplified and reduced language in the instructions, inviting users to get right to answering the questions with the least distractions so they can find benefits as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we continue to research our users’ needs and the government benefits that can meet them, we’ll add to and improve our collection of benefit locators. And we’ll continue to let you know what we discover.&nbsp;</p>

Learn the 3 tips we recommend to USAGov agents to ensure this. ,2023-06-27 14:30:00,2023-06-28T15:10:52.957Z,"<p>The <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/contact-center""><span>USAGov Contact Center</span></a> is committed to meeting customers’ needs empathetically, efficiently, and accurately.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<p>When a customer gets in touch, they are looking to be understood, and to quickly get the information they need. But when that doesn’t happen, it can lead to frustration for the customer and the agent. Clear and efficient communication can happen when agents follow some basic practices. Here are three tips we recommend to USAGov agents for interacting with our customers:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Listen Actively.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">We find that customers ask the same question in many different ways. So, it’s important for our agents to communicate back and forth with the customer to gain an understanding and agreement for the specific information they need.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">The best way to ensure an agent understands a customer’s needs is to use active listening throughout the interaction. Active listening is simply asking clarifying questions and not relying solely on the first thing a customer says, because the customer may be confused with the government’s terminology and processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Here is an example of miscommunication between an agent and a customer. The customer, a U.S. citizen, wanted to confirm if a degree obtained from another country is equivalent to the requirements for the same degree within the United States. But the agent assumed the customer was asking how to find a job in the United States.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Caller: Could you give me some help? My husband is a U.S. citizen, but he studied in Mexico and has a master’s degree in Mexico, but what can he do so he can validate his foreign degree in the U.S.?</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Agent: To find a job in the U.S.?</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Caller: Yes. I mean–If he can find a job even if he studied overseas, or if he needs to take some extra classes to validate his education from another country?</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Agent: I can give you information about how to find a job in the United States.</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Caller: But can he find any even though he studied in Mexico?</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Agent: I don't know how to answer that. That’s why I am saying if he wants to find a job, he can start looking, according to USA.gov, on the website CareerOneStop, and USAJobs</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Caller: Excuse me?</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Agent: CareerOneStop.org</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Caller: Someone told me that I need to communicate with the [inaudible] to get more information</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Agent: What is the name again?</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Caller: The letters SEP</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Agent: SEP?</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Caller: They say I can get information there, but when I put those letters in, it redirected me to your website USA.gov</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Agent: The information I am giving you is from USA.gov</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Caller: But there it says how to validate a career in the U.S. So I thought that by calling I can get more information.</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Agent: So he is studying or finished studying?</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Caller: He finished.</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Agent: So he needs a job.</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Caller: Yes, but my question is if he can do so even though he studied in another country. Is there any document from the U.S. that certifies that he can work here?</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Agent: But you said he is a U.S. citizen. He is not a foreigner. That would be different.</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Caller: Yes he is a U.S. citizen.</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Agent: If he is a U.S. citizen he just needs to find a job in the U.S. on CareerOneStop.org</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Caller: I will repeat back to you. [and she did]</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Agent: OK.</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Caller: Ok. I have to check there to see if he can find a job. And will they give me more information?</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Agent: Yes. Do you have another question?</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15;""><em>Caller: No. That will be all. I’ll check there.</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.5;"">This happened because the agent did not rephrase the question with the keywords offered by the customer. Listening for and using a customer’s keywords is the best way to begin an interaction and come to an agreement on what is needed. This is the way the interaction should have gone:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.15;""><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><em>Caller: Could you give me some help? My husband is a U.S. citizen, but he studied in Mexico and has a master’s degree in Mexico, but what can he do so he can validate his foreign degree in the U.S?</em></span></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.15;""><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><em>Agent: Could you please tell me what validating his foreign degree means? Is he trying to verify if his higher education diploma or certificate earned in another country is valid to work in the U.S.?</em></span><br><span style=""font-size: 15px;""></span></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.15;""><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><em>Caller: Yes. I mean–If he can find a job even if he studied overseas, or if he needs to take some extra classes to validate his education from another country?</em></span><br><span style=""font-size: 15px;""></span></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.15;""><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><em>Agent: I understand. I will look up some information on how to work in the U.S. if someone has a degree from another country, so he can work in the United States. Is that correct?</em></span><br><span style=""font-size: 15px;""></span></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.15;""><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><em>Caller: Yes.</em></span><br><span style=""font-size: 15px;""></span></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.15;""><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><em>Agent: I will start my research to better assist you. Please allow me a few moments.</em></span><br><span style=""font-size: 15px;""></span></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.15;""><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><em>Caller: Thank you.</em></span><br><span style=""font-size: 15px;""></span></p>

Do you have any further questions?</em></span><br><span style=""font-size: 15px;""></span></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.15;""><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><em>Caller: No. Thank you so much.</em></span></p>

<li><strong>Rely on your resources.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; line-height: 1.5;"">Agents should avoid providing information based on their memory because government processes may change and the information used before may be outdated. Agents must use the current agency-provided resources to ensure it is the most reliable information. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, information about travel restrictions changed rapidly. What was acceptable one day could be unacceptable the next day. While agents may answer similar questions multiple times a day, information can also change multiple times. Using the latest agency information is the key to providing accurate information.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; line-height: 1.5;"">This is an example of why agents need to check their resources to provide the most up-to-date information:<br><br><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><em>Caller: Can I travel to the U.S. without a vaccination?</em></span></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; line-height: 1.15;""><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><em>Agent: All foreign travelers, except children, need to have an approved vaccination.</em></span><br><span style=""font-size: 15px;""></span></p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li><strong>Tone matters. Remember to be empathetic.&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; line-height: 1.5;"">Customer service agents should be aware of subtle changes in their tone when dealing with customers as this can affect the outcome of a conversation. Even though our agents aren’t directly seeing customers, we recommend that agents smile when interacting with customers. It may sound odd, but it works to improve the tone of the interaction. We understand that agents might face difficult situations, but if they can put a smile in their voice, the interaction will run more smoothly and increase brand rapport.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; line-height: 1.5;"">Using positive statements instead of negative ones will set up a pleasant and more helpful experience for the customer. For example, an agent should use, “Let me see what I can find” instead of “I do not have an answer for that.” When we use positive statements, customers feel they are heard. Being empathetic is always a plus, so saying words such as “I am so sorry you are experiencing that situation,” or “I apologize for the inconvenience,” lets the customer know we are working together to find an answer or a resource. Customers want to know they are not alone in their journey.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; line-height: 1.5;"">This is an example showing how being empathetic can lead to a positive customer experience:&nbsp;<br><br><span style=""font-style: italic; font-size: 15px;"">Caller: I am seeking help. My family and I had a home for 14 years and it flooded in September. We are now renting but our lease is ending. We aren't able to be approved for a loan due to 1099 tax returns.

That knowledge helps USAGov serve them better through our other channels, too. Learn how the contact center and other teams at USAGov support each other in connecting people with their government.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2><span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #000000;"">Consistent information across channels</span></h2>
<p>Contact center agents rely on a knowledge base that is tied to USAGov’s websites. When the content team updates or publishes a new web page, the contact center’s knowledge base is automatically updated. Following this “create once, publish everywhere” approach helps us provide consistent and reliable government information across USAGov channels. This is especially helpful in quickly changing situations such as the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #000000;"">Regular cross-functional meetings</span></h2>
<p>Cross-team communication has been vital to our channels.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">The contact center’s knowledge base manager meets weekly with a liaison from the web content team. As they review topics that have come up during call and chat quality assurance assessments, they evaluate how well the knowledge base is serving agents. And together, they develop ways that the web content team can improve the information so it benefits agents, the people they’re helping, and website users.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Members of the contact center team attend the outreach team’s weekly brainstorming sessions to share current trends in call and chat questions from the public. Outreach team members use this information to address these popular topics in social media messaging.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #000000;"">Sharing data</span></h2>
<p>The contact center and analytics teams work closely to compile regular reports highlighting call and web chat trends including:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Spikes in questions about particular topics</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Overall monthly call and chat volume</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Which interactive voice response (IVR) topics callers choose the most</li>
</ul>
<p>Other teams across USAGov incorporate this data into their product development and find trends, discrepancies, and better ways to present information to the public. For example, if there is an increase in calls related to benefits programs, the outreach team will incorporate more benefits information into their editorial calendar to share with our social media and email audiences.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #000000;"">Listening sessions</span></h2>
<p>As a public-facing program, we learn so much from hearing directly from people, finding out what topics they’re asking about, and how they phrase their questions. That’s why we value our weekly listening sessions. Each Friday, team members from across USAGov listen together to agents handling live contact center calls. This helps us empathetically understand the public’s challenges as they search for government resources to solve their problems. And it helps us know how to enhance our knowledge base content to make it easier for agents to give people the information they need.</p>
<p>As we’re using these methods to learn from and support the contact center team, all of USAGov’s teams and channels are constantly looking for new ways to connect, share information, and help each other serve people.</p>

<!--more-->
<h2><span style=""font-size: 18px; color: #000000;"">The U.S. is a multilingual country</span></h2>
<p>According to a <span style=""color: #102d7b;""><a href=""https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/12/languages-we-speak-in-united-states.html"" style=""color: #102d7b;"">2019 U.S. Census Bureau survey</a></span>, nearly 68 million people in the U.S. speak a language other than English at home. And each year the U.S. welcomes more than 800,000 new citizens from all over the world.</p>
<p>Providing voting information in languages that reflect the diversity of U.S. citizens is an important way to help people exercise their right to vote. This is one of the foundational elements that drive our work.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 18px; color: #000000;"">We create culturally sensitive translations&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>The vote.gov team works with real people, not automated translation engines, to ensure that our information is accurate, reliable, and culturally sensitive. We partner with qualified language specialists at the <span style=""color: #102d7b;""><a href=""https://nlscorps.org/"" style=""color: #102d7b;"">National Language Service Corps (NLSC)</a></span>, a program within the Department of Defense that represents more than 500 languages and dialects. We also have an editorial team of language and cultural experts who provide additional translation and language support.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 18px; color: #000000;"">What languages does vote.gov offer?</span></h2>
<p>As of March 14, 2024, in addition to English and Spanish, vote.gov is available in these languages, with more to come:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arabic</li>
<li>Bengali&nbsp;</li>

<li>Yup’ik</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 18px; color: #000000;"">How did we choose which languages to offer?</span></h2>
<p>Vote.gov focuses on languages used by groups identified by <span style=""color: #102d7b;""><a href=""https://www.justice.gov/crt/language-minority-citizens"" style=""color: #102d7b;"">section 203 of the Voting Rights Act</a></span>, mentioned in the <span style=""color: #102d7b;""><a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/07/executive-order-on-promoting-access-to-voting/"" style=""color: #102d7b;"">Executive Order on Promoting Access to Voting</a></span>.

<p>Census data tells us that the top languages spoken in the United States (besides English) include Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, and Korean. Our analysis of site data confirms that the top non-English browser languages visiting vote.gov in 2022 were Spanish and Chinese.&nbsp;</p>

But we’re not finished. As we hear from users and collaborate with federal agencies, we’ll continue to develop better ways of providing a more seamless government experience for the people we serve. Here are some of the things we’ll be working on in the future:</p>
<!--more-->
<p><strong>Collecting and analyzing organic user data and feedback</strong> - Now that the new sites are visible to search engines, the visits will be more organic as people find us in search results and discover <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/a-new-approach-to-content-for-usagovs-beta-sites""><span>the original web content we create</span></a>. This new visibility will help us identify the search terms visitors use to find and search on our sites. Knowing these terms, and hearing from visitors through site feedback and surveys, will help us refine our content and identify any gaps in it. That will make it even more useful to the public, and to <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/using-beta-ensuring-an-efficient-omnichannel-experience""><span>USAGov’s contact center agents,</span></a> <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/using-beta-ensuring-an-efficient-omnichannel-experience""><span>who also rely on our websites</span></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rolling out and testing interactive features </strong>- We plan to build more interactivity on the sites, like our new <a href=""https://usa.gov/where-report-scams"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>where to report a scam tool</span></a>. Another tool we’re currently working on will help<span> </span>people find out if they’re eligible for government benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we’re creating new interactive features, we’re conducting user testing on existing ones, like our <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>contact your elected officials tool</span></a>. In testing this feature on our beta sites, most participants (17 out of 18) located the correct elected official they were asked to find. On our previous sites without the tool, just 2 out of 18 participants could locate the correct elected official. Testing also showed that it took people less time to get to the information they needed. The total average time saved compared to the old site was 5.22 minutes (57%) for tests conducted in English and 4:56 (49%) minutes on tests conducted in Spanish.</p>
<p><strong>Exploring cross-agency service completion opportunities </strong>- As we continue to build relationships with agencies, we’re working to identify opportunities to streamline federal service delivery through our websites. Our goal is to explore and eventually establish agency partnerships that enable simple cross-agency service completion and a more personalized experience for users.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Piloting accessible voice technology </strong>- Our team is in the early stages of designing, building, and deploying a pilot with end-to-end voice skills and actions that meet users’ needs. This pilot will help people get access to government information through voice search, smart speakers, and more.</p>

Specifically, we wanted to assess how well agents could digest the new content and then refer a customer to the correct agency or course of action.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""color: #102d7b;"">How we did it</span></h2>
<p>We held focus sessions with our 25 English and bilingual (Spanish-speaking) agents, presenting them with four scenarios. Each scenario ended with a question similar to the kind they answer on calls and chats. The scenarios also included links to the new content that would be most relevant to the situation. Based on the question and the content, we asked the agents:</p>
<ol style=""font-size: 17px;"">
<li style=""color: #0e101a;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""color: #0e101a;"">What information they would provide to the customer</span></li>
<li style=""color: #0e101a;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""color: #0e101a;"">How they would rate the efficiency of the new content (1 = not efficient 10 = very efficient)</span></li>
<li style=""color: #0e101a;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""color: #0e101a;"">What their rationale was for the rating&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 16px; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-size: 18px; color: #102d7b;"">What we learned</span>&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>In all four scenarios, the new information helped agents provide accurate answers to customers. They consistently provided the correct information and performed with 100% accuracy on two scenarios. In addition, they rated the new content as highly efficient, with a mean rating of 9.5 out of 10. Here are factors that contributed to their ratings:</p>
<ul style=""font-size: 17px;"">
<li style=""color: #0e101a;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""color: #0e101a;"">Findability: Speed is a key factor for efficiency, especially when a customer is waiting for an immediate response. When comparing the beta content with the current content, agents commented that the new website is easier to navigate to find answers.</span></li>
<li style=""color: #0e101a;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""color: #0e101a;"">Content structure: Agents mentioned that our new content page structure was easier for them to understand and explain. With new page elements like bullets, checklists, and filtering, it was easier to provide answers to customers.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style=""color: #0e101a;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""color: #0e101a;"">Specificity: According to agents’ comments, the beta sites’ content includes high-quality links that go directly to the resources that a customer would need. They also indicated that the writing was straightforward and focused on getting customers where they need to go.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">Creating omnichannel government experiences like this supports our CX goal of giving people dependably consistent information, regardless of the USAGov channels they use. We’ll continue to monitor our contact center agents’ feedback so we can keep making it easier to serve the people who get in touch with them, and who use our websites.</p>

USAGov Blog,Marketing Beta: Our Approach,Marketing Beta: Our Approach,en,/blog/2023/03/marketing-beta-our-approach,Angelica Perez,"Design and Development,Marketing,Multilingual,Performance and Analytics,USAGov","The USAGov team has been connecting people to government information for years. But, marketing beta was different. See the ways we changed our approach. ",2023-03-28 14:30:00,2023-04-05T15:44:51.883Z,"<p>Once USAGov launched <span>beta.USA.gov</span> and <span>beta.USA.gov en Español</span>, the outreach team had to market the new websites to the public. After years of connecting people to government information through social media, email marketing, featured content, and events, we used that expertise to get more eyes and action on the beta sites and encourage users to share their feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<p>But what was different about the beta outreach campaign? Here are the three main ways the team changed their approach for this new and exciting opportunity:</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""color: #102d7b;""><strong>1. The campaign is driven entirely by an internal product</strong>.&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>We primarily distribute information from across government agencies and provide a variety of source material for the public. The concept is driven by giving our followers and subscribers information as directly as possible, creating a “one click experience” to the service they need from a relevant agency website. During the beta campaign, we had to market our own product and give special consideration to branding, storytelling, and referring people directly to beta.USA.gov. It took an active shift to self promotion, <span style=""font-size: 17px;"">showing the audience what they can expect from a USAGov product. This included:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""color: #000000;"" aria-level=""2""><span style=""font-size: 17px; color: #000000;"">Establishing authority for the beta sites</span></li>
<li style=""color: #000000;"" aria-level=""2""><span style=""font-size: 17px; color: #000000;"">Appropriately adjusting and applying beta.USA.gov design elements</span></li>
<li style=""color: #000000;"" aria-level=""2""><span style=""font-size: 17px; color: #000000;"">Shifting to first-person language (“we, us, our”), rather than the standard outside-looking in, second-person narrative (“you, your”)</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""color: #102d7b;""><strong>2. It involves every part of USAGov.&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>
<p style=""font-size: 17px;"">After months of coordination and work from every USAGov team, the beta sites launched. With the beta sites receiving daily tests and updates, we included various expert perspectives to build and sustain the beta campaign. For example, before posting about any topic page or interactive tool, we coordinated with:</p>
<ul style=""font-size: 17px;"">
<li style=""color: #000000;"" aria-level=""2""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The content team to ensure the specific content was finalized before promotion</span></li>
<li style=""color: #000000;"" aria-level=""2""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The UX team to drive any specific testing or feedback goals</span></li>
<li style=""color: #000000;"" aria-level=""2""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The analytics team to monitor traffic, clicks, and other metrics</span></li>
<li style=""color: #000000;"" aria-level=""2""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The development team to flag any technical issues or code pushes that might impact the promotion</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""color: #102d7b;""><strong>3. We have a flexible, iterative timeline</strong>.&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>Many outreach campaigns are organized around an event t<span style=""font-size: 17px;"">hat inherently provides a specific timeline. The beta campaign is an ongoing campaign. It’s dynamic and changing constantly, just like the sites themselves. This poses creative challenges and opportunities to sustain the outreach campaign and keep it engaging for our audiences. To manage the evolving timeline, we created a phased, goal-oriented approach that became more efficient as we learned from it. Our phases included:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""color: #000000;"" aria-level=""2""><span style=""font-size: 17px; color: #000000;"">Raising awareness - measured in reach and impressions</span></li>
<li style=""color: #000000;"" aria-level=""2""><span style=""font-size: 17px; color: #000000;"">Gathering feedback - collecting survey comments and page-level feedback</span></li>
<li style=""color: #000000;"" aria-level=""2""><span style=""font-size: 17px; color: #000000;"">Taking action - traffic and interactions on beta pages; clicks through to official government resources through beta.USA.gov and beta.USA.gov/es</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 17px;"">Our beta.USA.gov campaign continues until we fully launch a new USA.gov.&nbsp;</span></p>

These websites are where we are building the next version of <a href=""http://www.usa.gov/""><span>USA.gov</span></a>. We want the future federal front door to be more human-centered, actionable, interactive, and accessible. But how do we know if the choices we have made are accomplishing these goals?&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In order to measure the effectiveness of our previous choices and to guide future decisions, we’re evaluating beta.USA.gov in a variety of ways.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""color: #102d7b;"">Usability Testing</span></h2>
<p>We present the website to a variety of possible users and interview them one at a time as they use it. We ask them to perform common and important tasks and observe to see if the website makes it easy or hard. We do unique tests for different parts of the website so we can get in-depth information about them. We even test designs and pictures of web pages so we can avoid mistakes before writing code. Because beta.USA.gov is a different website from our main site, USA.gov, we perform similar tests on each so we can compare the results. Find out more about how we adapted our user testing practices to measure the success of the beta site in our blog post: <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/5-changes-the-ux-team-made-for-beta""><span>5 Changes the UX Team Made for Beta</span></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""color: #102d7b;"">Coordinating Analytics and Outreach Strategies</span></h2>
<p>For us to compare beta.USA.gov and USA.gov, our analytics team works in coordination with our outreach team. Currently, most visitors to <span>USA.gov</span> come from a search engine with a task in mind. However, this is not the case with the beta site. We invite visitors to check out beta.USA.gov from USA.gov and by leveraging targeted social media and email campaigns. By strategically planning how we invite users to visit the beta site, we’re able to monitor influxes in traffic to certain pages and closely review the feedback we get from those users to help us make decisions about future functionality on the site. Future blog posts will go into further detail about how the USAGov team markets beta.USA.gov.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""color: #102d7b;"">Survey Comments</span></h2>
<p>We offer opportunities for feedback from visitors at different points of the experience on both beta.USA.gov and USA.gov. We ask visitors if they thought a page was helpful, if they found the information they needed, and more. The questions help us identify the groups of pages where we need to focus our efforts. Visitors also tell us about their experiences in their own words. We read these comments in order to identify improvements and prioritize feature development so we can make beta.USA.gov more helpful.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""color: #102d7b;"">Website Analytics</span></h2>
<p>We want to make sure that our visitors are as successful as possible. One of the ways we do that is by connecting them to the best possible place to accomplish their goal with the least amount of effort. We use custom website analytics to anonymously compare how the users of beta.USA.gov and <span>USA.gov</span> accomplish similar tasks. For example, what percentage of each site's visitors find and click a link to another government agency? How many choose to share the information with others on social media or email?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because beta.USA.gov is not finished, there are some types of pages still to come. Specifically, our beta site includes interactive tools that the current USA.gov website does not. To address these variations in user experiences on the beta site vs USA.gov, we are cautiously designing how we collect and report data. Our anonymous usage dashboards pinpoint certain key outcomes on both websites. This lets us take into account the different ways we need to measure success on the various features we develop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using these strategies across our websites, we hope our data will be informative and allow us to create the best version of USA.gov that we can.</p>

As part of the larger effort to reimagine the USAGov websites, our content team developed new data-driven processes and best practices that reshape how we present content for <span>beta.USA.gov</span> and <span>beta.USA.go</span><span>v en Español</span>.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 style=""font-size: 18px;""><strong>Creating sustainable content</strong></h2>
<p>The content team developed a beta content guide at the outset of the project to help our writers incorporate insights from data and follow best practices when researching and crafting content. The guide continues to be updated and includes information on search engine optimization (SEO), structuring content, plain language, and content accessibility.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 18px;""><strong>Letting data lead</strong></h2>
<p>While we’d used analytics and other data in the past, the beta project brought research to the forefront. No piece of content is now written without first checking our analytics accounts and researching keywords, search terms, survey responses, and contact center data.</p>
<p>Early in the project content design teams used this data to determine what content to include on the beta sites based on user needs. Our writers then built on this foundation, continuing to use data to determine how to structure information and write content optimized for search engine discoverability.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 18px;""><strong>Simplifying content based on user needs</strong></h2>
<p>Another shift in our content approach has been to focus on only one user need or task per page on the beta sites. Our current sites tend to have longer pages that address multiple user questions or tasks within a page. This often presents users with dozens of links to different government agencies that they have to read through to find what they’re looking for. The goal of our new approach is to reduce this information overload and focus on only the details users need to complete their task.</p>
<p>The result has been a larger total number of pages on the beta sites, but overall shorter pages. The average word count per page has decreased by 65 percent. Pages now feature either one call to action for the user or a smaller number of supporting links, with the average number of links per page decreasing by 79 percent.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 18px;""><strong>Linking out instead of recreating</strong></h2>
<p>Another reason our overall word counts have gotten lower is that we can rely more on other agency websites to meet user needs. Government websites have come a long way since we last refreshed the structure of our content eight years ago. They’re making information easier to find and available in plain language. So instead of having to recreate information on our sites, we can link out to more government content.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 18px;""><strong>Restructuring content</strong></h2>
<p>Our English and Spanish beta sites incorporate the <a href=""https://designsystem.digital.gov/""><span>U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)</span></a>, allowing our team to use new features and explore better ways to present content. We’ve added more structure to our content to make it easily scannable and accessible. Our pages now include subheadings, lists, accordions, and alert boxes. The content team also worked closely with our UX team in designing content for the bilingual interactive tools that help users <span>contact an elected official</span> and <span>report a scam</span>.</p>
<p>We rely on usage data to help determine how to structure and order content on pages. For example, on our current site’s federal student aid page, the link that takes users to the FAFSA application was not prominent on the page. But data showed that that was by far the most clicked link, so on the beta version of the student aid page, we made it easier to find. There is now a prominent call to action button near the top of the page to take users directly to the financial aid application.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p7Ve8JeEwIi7UGTL6ADHkxbf2FkVonX0GE7MXR2lpE5y2_WmjQzFGaV35RurQrg7_liXmtOmbijzEx9UIFFj1sP-08qT8DaYwT8WPvtMHHaR9PbZJzL60RHcEKwzVPmBJUxv67KpN0T1FTDB3uxZZ5s"" width=""624"" height=""395"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Comparison of student financial pages on the current and beta English sites.""></p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px;"">Caption: <em>Comparison of student financial pages on the current and beta English sites.</em></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 18px;""><strong>Thinking “mobile-first”</strong></h2>
<p>We know that almost 60 percent of visitors to our USAGov sites are using phones and tablets, so we take a mobile-first approach to content design. Our writers now draft content using a mobile template that allows them to always visualize what the content will look like on a small screen.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 18px;""><strong>Looking ahead</strong></h2>
<p>Now that the beta sites have been publicly available for a few months, the content team is reviewing beta-specific customer comments and user testing results. We’re working to fill in any gaps in our content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re also gearing up for the “cutover” when the beta sites replace <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/""><span>USA.gov</span></a> and <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/espanol/""><span>USAGov en Español</span></a>, making sure our SEO metadata is in place for a smooth transition. Once we reach that cutover point we will have even more customer data to draw on for evaluating our existing pages and determining future content needs.</p>

USAGov Blog,Testing Beta for Accessibility,Testing Beta for Accessibility,en,/blog/2023/03/testing-beta-for-accessibility,Angelica Perez,"Design and Development,Multilingual,Performance and Analytics,USAGov,User Experience and Accessibility",USAGov strives to ensure our websites are accessible. Learn how we validated that our beta sites met Section 508 and WCAG 2.0 compliance requirements.,2023-03-16 14:30:00,2023-04-05T15:42:59.039Z,"<p>The USAGov team strives to ensure all our websites are accessible to as many people as possible. This includes those who need the use of specialized assistive technologies when browsing the internet. As a result, in building beta.USA.gov we deliberately validated that it met Section 508 and WCAG 2.0 compliance requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This mindset wasn't only applied to the testing phase of beta but in all phases of the project including prototyping. Our testing approach includes a three step hybrid method that may be suitable for other agency use.</p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 16px; color: #000000;"">1. Automated testing</span></h2>
<p>We began testing by using automated tools that can scan every webpage of beta.USA.gov. These tools can check and report on WCAG noncompliance directly in your browser, which can be a helpful starting point as they provide quick and actionable feedback on your sites.</p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 16px; color: #000000;"">2. Screen reader testing</span></h2>
<p>After checking and fixing issues found during automated testing, we moved on to manual testing with screen readers. We tested the top three screen readers by usage (JAWS, VoiceOver, and NVDA) to ensure we weren’t only listening to our web pages with a single tool. This testing uncovered several universal issues that were on every page of the site, including:</p>
<ul style=""font-size: 17px;"">
<li><span style=""color: #000000;"">“Skip to main content” text being read in English on beta’s Spanish pages.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #000000;"">“Skip to main content”&nbsp; not moving users to the main heading of the page as it was supposed to.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #000000;"">Unreadable selected items in the left navigation menu.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #000000;"">Unnecessary HTML lists in the header.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #000000;"">Unreadable alternative text for images in the “Share this page” tool in our footer.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to this testing, we are able to address another layer of issues that automated testing could not scan.</p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 16px; color: #000000;"">3. Manual keyboard testing</span></h2>
<p>To support individuals who rely solely on keyboard navigation, we tested the site to ensure all elements had appropriate visual focus and could be navigated properly on keyboard. This level of testing showed that we needed to go back and apply visible focus to the U.S. Web Design System card component. To address this, we added an outline allowing the visual focus to be easier to find when tabbing through the page.</p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 16px; color: #000000;"">Working with our developers</span></h2>
<p>With the multi-step process to ensure an accessible website, clear communication was essential. A key part to our efforts was working with our developers throughout the entire process. We needed to ensure all team members understood any issues identified and next steps to correct those issues. To do this, we would replicate errors with the developer team so they could better understand what we were addressing. Beyond the universal understanding by team members, by promoting accessibility from the beginning, we have also been able to maintain our project schedule.</p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 16px; color: #000000;"">Future steps</span></h2>
<p>To ensure that our websites remain accessible, we incorporate accessibility into our work culture. Today, we routinely check our sites for any accessibility errors, maintain open lines of communication, and promptly address any issues. We are proud of the steps we have taken to make our website accessible, and we will continue to strive to make it even better.</p>

<p>In the past, our usability tests included many tasks and questions. It took our team a lot of time to do the synthesis and analysis to develop findings and recommendations. In the end, while that type of testing generated interesting and useful information, we couldn’t act on all of it.</p>
<p>In testing the beta sites, though, we set just a few clear and actionable goals for our tests and limited testing sessions to 3-5 tasks. This is helping us center our reports on our goals, and high-priority findings and recommendations can go directly into development.</p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #000000;"">2. Comparative usability testing</span></h2>
<p>During this time when both our current and beta sites are available to the public, we are seizing the opportunity to see how users interact with both sites. Using comparative usability testing in English and Spanish, we are determining if new features provide better experiences on beta. Then, we take the data gathered to address needs and pain points to improve beta.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #000000;"">3. Recruiting participants from underserved communities</span></h2>
<p>Recruiting participants for usability testing is challenging, especially when you want to get feedback from diverse viewpoints. We’ve always worked to ensure that not all of our test participants come from the same background, and the president’s <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/13/executive-order-on-transforming-federal-customer-experience-and-service-delivery-to-rebuild-trust-in-government/"">Customer Experience Executive Order</a> arrived at just the right time for us. We took the guidance from this executive order to further refine our recruitment strategy and modified questions in our participant screeners to help us reach members of underserved communities. Knowing there’s always room to improve our recruiting, we continue to experiment with strategies to help us connect with populations that might benefit most from our products and services so we can co-design with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #000000;"">4. USWDS components are our new standard</span></h2>
<p>USAGov was an early adopter of <a href=""https://designsystem.digital.gov/""><span>U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)</span></a> components, which make federal websites more accessible and easier to use. Long before we designed page templates for our beta sites, our content team looked at user data, survey comments, and our existing content to envision the best way to fully embrace USWDS standards and components. These components are now integrated into every aspect of the beta sites, from buttons to process lists to alert boxes. We’re using the components with as little customization as possible. But when we need to tweak a component to make it work for our sites, we share the revised code with the USWDS team.</p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #000000;"">5. Launching imperfect tools and making iterative improvements based on data</span></h2>
<p>It takes a mindset shift to make a website feature go live when you know you could refine it further. But our team is working on launching tools and website features in their earlier MVP (minimum viable product) state. Though not in their final version, the tools and features are complete enough to launch so we can collect data on their use and make changes to improve them. This is hard for a team of perfectionists who don't want to create a potentially less-than-ideal user experience. But MVPs save time and effort. And we’re committed to launching earlier, learning more, and making iterative improvements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One example of an MVP on our beta sites is our <span>Scams Wizard</span> tool which helps people determine where to report scams and fraud. Right now, the tool can help you figure out how to report 3 different types of scams. We know there are many more types of scams and fraud, but we focused on the top 3 as our MVP. We’re doing usability testing on the tool and based on the results, will continue to refine the tool and add to its content.</p>
<p>Our UX team is constantly working to learn more about how our users interact with our sites and to make iterative improvements.</p>

<!--more-->
<h2><span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #000000;"">A New Foundation To Build Beta</span></h2>
<p><span style=""color: #222222;"">As we've been developing new versions of our websites, our leaders at USAGov saw the benefit of adopting more product management principles across the USAGov program. They created a new product team to lead in building the beta sites. This transition to a more robust product management model has made an impact on our decision-making processes, work practices, and culture.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #222222;"">The diverse beta product team makes the decisions for all aspects of beta site creation. The team is composed of members of functional teams from across USAGov. It includes a content designer, a UX researcher, an engineer, and a product manager. This empowers those closest to the product to make informed decisions, with each member sharing their expert view.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">How we define and measure success has also changed as a result of using product management principles. For years, we tracked the number of unique website visits as one of our success metrics. Now, we measure our success by how well we’re helping users complete tasks and find the answers they need. We track this through user testing, analytics, and customer satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">The shift to product management also made more space for experimentation and learning. We’re more easily able to try new approaches, learn from them, and pivot if necessary. New internal practices we've implemented allow for open cross-team communication. We also host regular retrospective meetings to help us reflect on the process of building a website feature. These sessions allow us to learn from and improve our workflows. As we test new approaches, we are able to pivot when another approach seems more beneficial. This way of work has connected silos, increased efficiency, and encouraged innovation.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">We will continue to iterate on our work processes and can already see a difference with more effective collaboration in building new website features, helping us meet our mission of delivering a bilingual product that puts the public and their needs first.</span></p>",https://532040.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/532040/Building%20Beta.jpg,,PUBLISHED,false

<!--more--><p>In 2022, we focused on creating Facebook and Instagram stories to supplement our outreach strategy. Stories are a short, customizable way to engage users through photos or videos in between scheduled posts on Facebook and Instagram. They last just 24 hours and appear at the top of a user’s news feed. This makes them easy to notice and appealing to click.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using stories has helped us increase our engagement rate and our number of followers as we deliver helpful information to people. Stories may be a good addition to your agency’s social media strategy, too. These three tips can help you get started using social media stories.</p>
<p><strong>Create weekly or monthly themes</strong></p>
<p>Creating themes helps your audience know what to expect from your page and establishes your agency as the subject matter expert. At USAGov, we create themes around events or campaigns. For example, during back-to-school time and Hispanic Heritage Month, we created weekly stories that focused on different topics around those themes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Provide short educational content</strong></p>
<p>Social media stories are a great way to turn longer forms of content like blogs or emails into short and quick messages. If there are topics that perform well on your social media pages, consider turning them into stories. Summarize the content and only highlight 2-3 key points. If there are more than 2-3 key points, consider creating a series or making a part two. Each week at USAGov, we turn our highest-performing emails into stories.</p>
<p><strong>Ask questions through surveys or quizzes</strong></p>
<p>The more your audience engages with your content, the more the algorithm will push your content to other users. Surveys and quizzes are a quick way to engage your audience and have your content seen. At USAGov, we ran a #FactFriday story campaign, posting facts on various topics and using a quiz to test our audience.</p>
<p>Through Facebook and Instagram stories, we have been able to increase our engagement rate by 42% and we increased our followers from 50K to 90K on Instagram. Overall, stories are an easy and important way to supplement your social media strategy. As the algorithm continues to change on social media, stories provide a free way to engage and reach new audiences.&nbsp;</p>",https://532040.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/532040/3%20Tips%20for%20Using%20Facebook%20and%20Instagram%20Stories.png,,PUBLISHED,false

USAGov’s new online locator tool helps people find government benefits and services geared to major life events. It officially launched in early August, and we wanted to give you an update.</p>

<p>The first life event covered by BEARS is the death of a loved one. Following the loss of a family member, a person can use the locator to find the benefits they might be eligible for, such as survivor payments, military funerals, and housing help. After answering some simple questions, they will get a custom list of potential federal benefits from a variety of agencies, and learn the steps to apply.&nbsp;</p>

<li aria-level=""1"">Validate and iterate on the content and design through survey feedback and user testing exercises</li>

<p>On September 18, 2022, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) will sunset Go.USA.gov. If you’re a Go.USA.gov user, these answers to common questions can help you know what to do to prepare for the end of the service.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 19px; color: #154285;"">How should I move forward?</span></strong></h3>
<p>We recommend considering the following when evaluating your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Do your outreach channels require short URLs?</strong> Consider if URLs that include your website’s domain have more value to your public and if your outreach tools require short URLs.</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Does using a URL shortening solution expose your customers to security risks?</strong> Consider the potential for abuse by malicious actors through the use of illegitimate redirects that can be abused via short URLs.</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Does using a short URL that isn’t based on your primary domain cause confusion with your customers?</strong> Consider the possible confusion the public may have if they visit shortened URLs that don't include your website’s domain for information and it leads them to information they weren’t expecting.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 19px; color: #154285;"">When does the service formally end?</span></strong></h3>
<p>GSA will sunset the Go.USA.gov service on September 18, 2022.</p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 19px; color: #154285;"">Will I be able to create new Go.USA.gov short URLs until the sunset date?</span></strong></h3>
<p>You will no longer be able to create new Go.USA.gov short URLs after August 31, 2022.</p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 19px; color: #154285;"">Will short URLs still work after September 18, 2022 (i.e. live on forever)?</span></strong></h3>
<p>Since the original posting of these FAQs, we have been continuing to investigate ways of ensuring as many Go.USA.gov short URLs continue to work after the sunsetting as possible.&nbsp; Originally, we only felt confident in being able to ensure shortened links created prior to 2017 would continue to work due to some technical changes made to Go.USA.gov back then. However, we are now able to capture the majority of short URLs generated by the system since 2009 and anticipate that the majority of Go.USA.gov short URLs in existence on September 18, 2022 will continue to work after the sunsetting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 19px; color: #154285;"">How do I know when my URL was created?</span></strong></h3>
<p>The URL creation date is listed along with the corresponding long URL under the “Your Links” section. To access the “Your Links” section, log in to Go.USA.gov and click the “Home” link in the site’s header.</p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 19px; color: #154285;"">What happens if a user tries to follow/access a Go.USA.gov short URL after the service is sunset?</span></strong></h3>
<p>We have been able to capture the majority of short URLS generated by the system since 2009 and anticipate that the majority of Go.USA.gov short URLS in existence on September 18, 2022 will continue to work after the sunsetting.</p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 19px; color: #154285;"">What can be done if Go.USA.gov short URLs were referenced in print publications?</span></strong></h3>
<p>We have been able to capture the majority of short URLS generated by the system since 2009 and anticipate that the majority of Go.USA.gov short URLS in existence on September 18, 2022 will continue to work after the sunsetting.</p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 19px; color: #154285;"">Will metrics be available for clicks made on a short URL after the service is sunset?</span></strong></h3>
<p>No. Any clicks made on a short URL after the September 18th sunset date will not be updated and access to the metrics reporting functionality will no longer be available.</p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 19px; color: #154285;"">Can we still download the metrics for our short URLs once the service is sunset?</span></strong></h3>
<p>No. You will need to download metrics prior to September 18, 2022.</p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 19px; color: #154285;"">How do we download our metrics before the service is sunset?</span></strong></h3>
<p>You can download a CSV file of the click counts for all of your shortened URLs by logging in to your account. Under the ""Your Links"" section, you can view the metrics for each of your short URLs and export them to CSV. For additional information, please visit the <span>support page on accessing your short URL metrics</span>. Bulk downloads of metrics are not possible and you must download them individually.</p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 19px; color: #154285;"">What if we use the Go.USA.gov API to automatically generate short URLs?</span></strong></h3>
<p>The Go.USA.gov API will become inaccessible for creating new short URLs after August 31, 2022.</p>
<p>We have been able to capture the majority of short URLS generated by the system since 2009 and anticipate that the majority of Go.USA.gov short URLS in existence on September 18, 2022 will continue to work after the sunsetting.</p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 19px; color: #154285;"">What other URL shortener services are out there for agencies to use?</span></strong></h3>
<p>Before looking for alternative URL shortening solutions, you may want to consider if you need a short URL at all. Many social media sites are no longer limiting character counts in URLs. Our research with the public strongly suggests that a URL from your own domain is the most trustworthy. For example, see <a href=""https://twitter.com/MedicareGov"" style=""color: #154285;""><span>Medicare’s Twitter feed</span></a>.</p>
<p>If you require short URLs, reach out to the agency’s IT office that runs your website. They may be able to create a redirect URL. There are also commercial URL shorteners available. However, your usage of these may be impacted by policies your agency has in place.</p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 19px; color: #154285;"">How does this affect the other services I receive from GSA?</span></strong></h3>
<p>The other services you receive from GSA are not affected. This notification is limited in scope to Go.USA.gov.</p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 19px; color: #154285;"">If I have other questions that aren’t answered here, who can I ask?</span></strong></h3>
<p>If you have any additional questions about the sunsetting of Go.USA.gov, please email us at <span style=""color: #154285;"">go.usa.gov@gsa.gov</span>.</p>",https://532040.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/532040/go.usa.gov.png,,PUBLISHED,false

<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">COVID-19 Information for 4 Million Visitors</span></strong></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">As the COVID-19 pandemic continued to unfold last year, we recognized that we needed to pull together the COVID-19 </span><span style=""color: #222222;"">content that was scattered across our websites. W</span><span style=""color: #000000;"">e reviewed </span><a href=""https://www.usa.gov/website-analytics""><span>analytics from the websites</span></a><span style=""color: #000000;"">, social media, and contact center to ensure we were answering what our users wanted to know about the pandemic. And we created dedicated​, comprehensive​ sections on our English and <span style=""text-decoration: none;"">Spanish</span> websites to address their questions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">To date, our COVID-19 sections have had more than 4 million unique page views combined</span><span style=""color: #222222;"">. </span><span style=""color: #000000;"">We continue to update our COVID-19 content as we monitor the news and what ​people are searching for.</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Closer Collaboration Between the Content Design and Contact Center Teams</span></strong></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><a href=""https://www.usa.gov/contact""><span>USAGov’s contact center</span></a><span style=""color: #000000;""> and its websites use the same content database. But the content had always been focused primarily on our web visitors. We knew we needed a better way to address </span><span style=""color: #000000;"">the main questions the contact center agents receive from the public. So l</span><span style=""color: #000000;"">ast year we created a liaison position. The contact center now alerts the liaison about trends in questions they’re receiving from the public, such as traveling to the U.S. during the pandemic. And they request additional information that agents can share with people who get in touch. The liaison communicates the request to the content design team, and a content writer researches and updates the content database.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The liaison also informs the contact center about new or updated content driven by website search trends–such as FEMA funeral benefit assistance or the COVID-19 eviction moratorium ending. This helps the agents get ready to answer related questions.</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">A Deep Dive into Our Websites’ Content</span></strong></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">In 2021, we rethought the way we designed all of the content on our English and Spanish websites. First, we inventoried and audited every piece of content on the websites and deleted topics that were beyond our scope</span><span style=""color: #000000;"">. We also worked with our analytics team to review page visits and usage metrics to </span><span style=""color: #000000;"">decide what content should stay and what should go</span><span style=""color: #000000;"">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Since 57% of USAGov and 76% of </span><span style=""color: #000000;"">USAGov en Español</span><span style=""color: #000000;""> visitors use mobile devices to access us, we worked with our user experience team to improve our websites for these audiences. This meant having one main user intent on a page instead of five or six, so pages wouldn’t be so long. It also meant using </span><a href=""https://digital.gov/topics/uswds/""><span>US Web Design System</span></a><span style=""color: #000000;""> bullets, buttons, and subheads to make it easier for people to find information on the page.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Finally, we began rewriting all of the content on our websites based on our research. Our refreshed websites will be available to the public later this year.</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Key Takeaway: User-Centered Content</strong></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">These 2021 accomplishments were made possible by an important lesson that we’ve learned over time. After reviewing metrics on what information people were actually looking for on our websites and other channels, including the contact center, we’ve been shifting away from an editorial mindset where we wrote what we <em>thought</em> was important to people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Last year’s projects reinforced the importance of using data to design user-centered content. We reviewed search terms, page visits, link use, visitor comments, and contact center questions to decide what content to create, update, or delete. This “data first” approach is now the protocol for our content decisions.</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">We’re excited about what we accomplished in 2021.

<p><strong><span style=""color: #222222;"">Reaching Over 1.5 Million People During Hispanic Heritage Month&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""color: #222222;"">We hosted a Hispanic Heritage Month (HHM) public engagement campaign from September 15 to October 15, 2021, to celebrate the culture and experience of the Hispanic/Latino community in the U.S. We recognized that there is a lot of confusing and deceptive information online in Spanish. So USAGov en Español used HHM as an opportunity to combat disinformation and provide official resources.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #222222;"">For the 2021 campaign, the USAGov en Español team led the effort and worked directly with subject matter experts at agencies including the IRS, TravelGov, OSHA, and FDA to coordinate public-facing messages about their programs and services.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #222222;"">We promoted agency websites and social media handles directly on our @USAGovespanol social media and email marketing channels using the unified hashtag </span><a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/TuGobiernoEnEspa%C3%B1ol?src=hashtag_click""><span>#TuGobiernoEnEspañol</span></a><span style=""color: #222222;"">. Additionally, we created </span><span>original content like articles and graphics</span><span style=""color: #222222;""> that the public and media shared and reproduced.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #222222;"">Overall, we reached over 1.5M people during the HHM 2021 campaign.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #222222;"">Serving as the Official Channel for Emergency Communication to the Public&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""color: #222222;"">USAGov has a unique role in emergency response and communication for the federal government. The program is</span><span style=""color: #000000;""> designated by the Department of Homeland Security as the federal government’s official disaster communications channel to the public. 2021 brought a very active Atlantic hurricane season and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic among other emergencies, and USAGov outreach was ready to take action.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">In 2021, we shared official and trustworthy information through our social media and email channels on topics like economic impact payments, affordable housing, SNAP benefits (food stamps), and travel restrictions in both English and Spanish. The team coordinated with agencies to support their needs to ensure consistent messaging and answers to the public. Overall, in 2021, we reached people over 12 million times with information about the coronavirus through USAGov outreach channels.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Additionally, in May 2021, just before the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season, @USAGov and @USAGovEspanol hosted bilingual Twitter chats, connecting experts to the public. The </span><a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChatBeforeTheStorm?src=hashtag_click""><span>#ChatBeforeTheStorm</span></a><span style=""color: #000000;""> and </span><a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/antesdelatormenta?src=hashtag_click""><span>#AntesDeLaTormenta</span></a><span style=""color: #000000;""> events reached over 1.2 million people, thanks to engaging questions about preparing and staying safe during an emergency and collaboration with agencies including NOAA, NWS, and FEMA.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: #222222;"">In two hours of live chats hosted in March 2021, we asked 22 questions, worked with 27 partner accounts, received more than 400 tweet replies, and garnered more than 3 million impressions.</span></p>

USAGov Blog,Creating a New Way for People to Discover Government Benefits,Creating a New Way for People to Discover Government Benefits,en,/blog/2022/03/creating-a-new-way-for-people-to-discover-government-benefits,Jasmine Wood,"Content,Design and Development,Multilingual,User Experience and Accessibility",USAGov and the Benefits Eligibility Awareness Resource Service (BEARS) Team are working on a new tool designed to help people access the government services that meet their needs.,2022-03-15 13:22:18,2022-03-15T17:59:26.946Z,"<p>Connecting people with the federal services they need is the focus of the USAGov program. We get a lot of traffic on <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/""><span>USA.gov</span></a> and <a href=""http://usa.gov/espanol""><span>USAGov en Espa</span><span style=""color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;"">ñol</span></a>, and a lot of questions at our call center and on social media about government benefits, grants, and loans. People are eager for help with bills, housing, and food assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>To make it even easier for everyone to find services and benefits without needing to understand government structure, we’re developing a new digital tool in partnership with <a href=""https://10x.gsa.gov/""><span>10x, GSA’s incremental technology fund</span></a>.</p>
<p>The working name of the new tool is BEARS, the Benefits Eligibility Awareness Resource Service. It helps people discover and access the government services that meet their specific needs based on major life events. For example, if someone has recently lost a job and is experiencing financial hardship, they can identify benefits they might be eligible for with a few simple steps. Or if someone has recently lost a loved one, they can identify benefits relevant for that sad milestone.</p>
<p>A simple and straightforward filtering system allows users to view the benefits that are most likely to meet their needs for that life event. Each benefit is presented in a standard format, using simplified language. All the key eligibility criteria are presented in an easy-to-scan format. And the criteria that apply in the user’s situation are checked off.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 17px;"">Nearing Its Final Phase</span></h2>
<p>BEARS is currently an MVP (minimum viable product) and has just been approved for 10x’s Phase 4, the final 10x phase intended to scale what we’ve built. We’ll be adding more benefits, and validating the design along the way with plenty of user testing. In addition, we’ll be working on developing proactive notifications, so the system can notify users when they become eligible for additional benefits. This makes BEARS a truly customer-centric benefits tool. After Phase 4, BEARS will graduate from the 10x program and will be fully owned and managed by USAGov, which along with 10x is part of <a href=""https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services/tts-solutions""><span>TTS Solutions</span></a>.</p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 17px;"">Help People Find Your Agency’s Services&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>BEARS will eventually cover all federal benefits from all agencies. And we’re taking on the big challenge of simplifying the user experience and standardizing benefits criteria across agencies without losing the subtleties of eligibility.</p>
<p>The BEARS team, together with USAGov, has been engaging with federal agencies that provide benefits to the public. We want to make sure we're presenting the best information for each benefit program. If you are part of an agency managing and administering federal benefits, please reach out to USAGov at <a href=""mailto:usapartnerships@gsa.gov""><span>usapartnerships@gsa.gov</span></a><span style=""color: #1155cc;"">. </span>We would be grateful to get your help so we can be sure the information listed for your program is correct.</p>
<p>BEARS is an important step forward in providing an integrated, simple solution for federal benefits to improve the customer experience. We’re looking forward to working with you to make it happen. Together we can deliver better services to the people who rely on our programs.</p>",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/a5kfcWWwMu4Yc9N4-PmJv1q3CtI4qmO3QdQP-yFoDTW04OIWJYrh1rHXJzTQMXHu7QrmGmVDqZ2LsutlRIxA1QSXoRyhWnYTFAp0X_B9xaNyYf46CdMDEIOTvcp6nUZPCbYq6dg-,,PUBLISHED,false

<p><!--more--></p>
<p>What does a <a href=""https://connect.usa.gov/digital-toolkit-levels-of-partnership""><span>partnership with USAGov</span></a> entail? We can work together to decide which tactics and platforms work best for your message and target audiences. And we can carry out campaigns together to share your message with more than 2 million USAGov followers and subscribers. We focus on timely topics that have a high impact on the public. Though all government information is important, some topics can be too niche or technical for our audience. The team determines the best topic and approach to fulfill our role and meet the USAGov mission. Here are three of the top ways we collaborate with partners:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Social Media Posts and Events</strong></p>
<p>USAGov uses data from our English and Spanish channels to create marketing strategies. We keep up with the latest digital trends and work with platform algorithms to amplify messaging. We can help you decide where to focus your attention, based on the audience you’d like to reach. For example, we partnered with the Department of Education to host interactive Instagram story Q&amp;As. The campaign introduced a younger audience to the FAFSA application process. And for a fast-paced, collaborative focus, we partnered with multiple agencies to host the <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChatBeforeTheStorm?src=hashtag_click""><span>#ChatBeforeTheStorm</span></a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/AntesDeLaTormenta?src=hashtag_click""><span>#AntesDeLaTormenta</span></a> emergency preparedness Twitter events in May 2021. With social media, the opportunities are endless.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Email Marketing</strong></p>
<p>If you’re wondering “Is email marketing still important?” we are here to tell you: yes, it is. A strong email marketing campaign helps you stay connected with your audience as a whole, as well as with segmented age and interest groups. Throughout the pandemic, we’ve worked with agencies to promote key messages on <a href=""https://connect.usa.gov/where-and-how-to-get-the-covid-19-vaccine""><span>vaccine information</span></a>, <a href=""https://connect.usa.gov/watch-out-for-scammers-and-unemployment-benefits""><span>unemployment scams</span></a>, <a href=""https://connect.usa.gov/help-for-those-facing-eviction""><span>housing relief</span></a>, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Featured Content on USA.gov and USAGov en Español</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.usa.gov/features""><span>Our features page</span></a> covers a wide range of topics and is geared directly to the media. Features are a special addition to our websites during a marketing campaign. They help drive media attention to partner websites and to USA.gov. We worked with TravelGov from the Department of State to help explain COVID-19 passport procedures and travel restrictions. And with bilingual channels, we can post separately and customize information. In the USAGov en Español version of the travel feature, we included resources exclusively for the Spanish-speaking community.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s Work Together</strong></p>
<p>Does your agency have an idea for a new marketing strategy? USAGov’s Outreach team can support your agency in all stages of your campaign. We can brainstorm with your team, discuss best practices, and try new marketing approaches to grow together in serving people.

<p><!--more--></p>
<p>When the Federal Trade Commission and Social Security Administration asked us to help them disseminate information about National Consumer Protection Week (NCPW) in March, we knew hosting Twitter chats would be a powerful way to work with our agency partners to help protect people from scams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the NCPW Twitter chats #SlamTheScamChat in English and #OjoConLasEstafas (Beware of Scams) in Spanish, we addressed FAQs, tracked conversations through special hashtags, and brought attention to partner agencies’ social media accounts. In two hours of live chats, we asked 22 questions, worked with 27 partner accounts, received more than 400 tweet replies, and garnered more than 3 million impressions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some best practices we followed and lessons we learned:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Tailor your questions to the current state of the world. </strong>According to the FTC, Americans have <a href=""https://public.tableau.com/profile/federal.trade.commission#!/vizhome/COVID-19andStimulusReports/FraudLosses""><span>lost more than $477 million in scams linked to COVID-19</span></a> since the beginning of the pandemic. So this year, we adjusted the focus of our NCPW Twitter chat to address COVID-19-related consumer tips in addition to general scam education.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Retweet and quote agency responses for more visibility. </strong>We relied on agency experts for answers to questions during the NCPW Twitter chats. We posted those answers both as simple shares and quote tweets. This helped us reinforce the legitimacy of our partners and the power of the resources they shared.</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Manage virtually with ease. </strong>This year of social distancing taught us the importance of good email communication and the power of video conferencing. Before the event, the USAGov team defined roles like retweeters and hashtag trackers and during the event, the team joined a video call to coordinate.</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Continue to make events collaborative. </strong>Agency and organizational partners want to participate in Twitter chats if the chats are within their mission scope, are easy to join, and have a large reach. We recruited agency partners well ahead of time and provided messaging and promotional graphics that agencies could use to let their audiences know about the chats.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Follow trends in hashtag use and tweet formatting. </strong>With the #SlamTheScamChat and #OjoConLasEstafas event hashtags and the use of #NCPW2021, we linked to the week’s observance and kept conversation relevant to the chats themselves. In the future, we can reuse these unique hashtags by highlighting them in our display name and bio on <a href=""https://twitter.com/USAGov""><span>@USAGov</span></a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/USAGovEspanol""><span>@USAGovespanol</span></a>. We also used emojis as eyecatchers where appropriate. And we created white space to call out sentences and questions and created high-resolution, properly sized images.</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Find ways to engage directly with the public and media. </strong>Our chats were fueled by information from agencies rather than questions from the public. In our next chats, we would like to explore ways to gather people’s questions, including creating interactive polls and asking for audience input directly.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The NCPW Twitter chats were a win for everyone. The public got answers to FAQs and resources from experts. Government agencies and programs showed their expertise. And USAGov played its role as the aggregator of reliable government information.&nbsp;</p>

Our </span><a href=""https://usa.gov/federal-agencies""><span>A-Z Index of U.S. Government Departments and Agencies</span></a><span style=""color: #000000;""> directory is a popular feature and the result of many years of user testing and website user metrics.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Over time, we’ve noticed a pain point when people search to find a government agency on our site. If someone searches for a federal agency using the USA.gov main search box located in the header, our agencies directory content doesn’t always appear high in the search results. <a href=""https://search.gov/""><span>Search.gov</span></a> powers that search box and many others across the federal government. We consulted with them to find out how to change the situation. There were no short-term changes we could make to improve the search results, so we began looking for other options.</p>
<p>We decided to try adding a second search box to our agencies directory pages. It would search our agency content only. But two search boxes on a page can sometimes be confusing instead of helpful to users. Before this additional feature went live, we did user testing with a working prototype in one of our development environments.</p>
<p>Our goals for the user test were to:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Learn if people noticed the agency-only search box</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Find out if people were inclined to use the agency-only search box</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Discover if people thought the federal agency search was useful and effective</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Find out if having two search boxes on one page would be confusing</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on testing, we found that users noticed the new agency-only search box and found it easy to use. Some research participants weren’t clear about the difference between our two search boxes on the page. This was particularly true when a user was on a government agency's directory page, for example, the <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/federal-agencies/social-security-administration""><span>Social Security Administration page</span></a>, and they were asked during testing to search for something that was not a federal agency. To address this issue:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level=""1"">We took a close look at website usage data to see if it was common for users on the agencies directory pages to seek information other than agency contact information. It turns out that it’s not common. Most people come to the agencies directory to get contact information, and then leave.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">We made some design changes to our prototype to give our users visual clues that the search boxes were different, and integrated the agency-only search box more closely with the directory navigation elements.</li>
</ol>
<p>We also decided to add “previous” and “next” buttons to the bottom of our pages that listed agencies alphabetically. While a majority of people visit our directory to find contact information for an agency and then leave our site, many stay in the directory and browse around to learn about agencies and what they do. Since we launched the new design, our data shows that the people who stay and browse the agencies directory frequently use these “previous” and “next” buttons.</p>
<p>After successful testing, we officially launched the <a href=""http://usa.gov/federal-agencies""><span>""Search for a Federal Agency"" box in our agencies directory</span></a> in February 2021. Since then we’ve been keeping a close eye on search queries entered into both of our search boxes and are reassured that we created a design that’s easy for people to use correctly.</p>",https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/532040/Search_Box.png,,PUBLISHED,true
USAGov Blog,Partner Spotlight: Informing the Public About the 2020 Census,Partner Spotlight: Informing the Public About the 2020 Census,en,/blog/2021/05/partner-spotlight-informing-the-public-about-the-2020-census,Jasmine Wood,"Content,Marketing,Multilingual,Performance and Analytics",USAGov collaborated with the 2020 Census National Partnerships (NP) team in March of 2020 to educate the public on the importance of completing the 2020 census in lieu of a global pandemic. ,2021-05-04 13:11:46,2023-04-13T14:31:07.161Z,"<p>2020 posed an interesting challenge for the USAGov outreach team. We needed to focus on getting the latest pandemic information to the public, and we wanted to collaborate with agency experts to promote other timely and important topics too.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>One of those timely topics was the 2020 Census. People were calling the USAGov Contact Center, searching for information on USA.gov, and crowdsourcing questions on social media to learn about response deadlines and how the census would be conducted during the pandemic. Given the importance of the census to local communities, we started sharing information early in the year and connected with the Census Bureau. Following a Census Bureau presentation to the <a href=""https://digital.gov/communities/multilingual/""><span>government-wide Multilingual Community of Practice (COP)</span></a>, we ignited a collaboration with their 2020 Census National Partnerships (NP) team.</p>
<p>Starting in March 2020, we met regularly with the NP team and set expectations of what topics they were looking to promote, including:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">What the census is and why it’s done</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">The benefits of filling out the 2020 Census</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">How to respond to the census--online, by phone, and through the mail&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">What questions to expect from the census</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Important dates, websites, and changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>We combined the priorities and changing deadlines of the Census Bureau with the reach and strategy of USAGov, along with data from both programs, to create clear, helpful messaging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together, we:</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Amplified key information via outreach channels</span> - We used all of USAGov’s English and Spanish social media and email channels to promote information on the benefits of the 2020 Census, how to respond, census data security, and other priority topics provided by the Census Bureau. We reached more than 678,000 people with this information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Created new and updated existing web pages to highlight 2020 Census priorities</span> - We worked with the USAGov content team to share census information directly on <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/statistics#item-214651""><span>USA.gov</span></a> and <span>USAGov en Español</span>. This promoted our web content and helped Census engage typically harder-to-reach populations, such as Spanish-speakers, through our existing audience.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Highlighted the 2020 Census on USA.gov and USAGov en Español homepages</span> - From July 1 to October 5, 2020, we highlighted our census web content directly on our homepages. This made the content more visible and brought more than 12,000 additional clicks to our census web content.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Featured and syndicated original content</span> - Our team repurposed information from the <span>2020 Census site</span> as a bilingual guide <span>hosted on USA.gov’s</span> and <span>USAGov en Español's featured article pages</span>. We distributed each article through a wire service to local and national media outlets. Since mid-June, these articles have been picked up by 223 media outlets and have nearly 12,000 views.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Used Instagram to target a younger audience</span> - College-age people are one of the harder populations to reach with census information. We regularly shared @uscensusbureau posts as Story Highlights on our <a href=""http://instagram.com/usagov""><span>Instagram page</span></a> and created our own original messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Focused outreach efforts on Spanish-speaking communities</span> - One goal of the NP team and an opportunity we supported was to provide official information from a trusted Spanish-language brand to people with low English proficiency. We used the USAGov en Español channels on Facebook and Twitter to disseminate census information and reached more than 138,000 people during the targeted campaign.</p>
<p>Over the course of 2020, we learned a lot about what aspects of the census interested our audience:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Top social media posts included <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CBoKs99nTMc/""><span>how the Census Bureau protects people’s data and privacy</span></a>, and information about temporary jobs as response takers.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Data can be compelling for our audience! They engaged with posts containing <a href=""https://twitter.com/USAGov/status/1248347450185834496""><span>simple data points</span></a> and easy-to-read data visualizations showing things like census response rates by state.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">We tested poll features on social media posts to increase clicks. People engaged enthusiastically and we’ll continue to test this and other new ways to directly socialize with our audience.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Many people indicated that they were concerned about the impact of the pandemic on the 2020 Census, including how to interact with census takers in their community.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re grateful that despite the challenges of the pandemic, we were able to work directly with the experts at the Census Bureau, and we’re excited to see the <a href=""https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/04/2020-census-data-release.html"">first round of 2020 Census results</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Agencies have been using Facebook and Twitter for years. But many are still unlocking the power of Instagram to share resources in an engaging, simple manner.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>At <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/explore""><span>USAGov</span></a>, we have been experimenting with our Instagram page and how to grow our following. Through strategic planning and creativity, we’re learning to reach more people and better understand what kind of information they need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you wondering how your agency can grow your Instagram followers and engagement? Here are some things we’ve learned so far.</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level=""1"">Treat Instagram like a blog because it requires strategic planning.&nbsp;</li>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""2"">Although it may seem as if companies post on Instagram randomly, it actually requires a great deal of pre-planning. We plan out our Instagram content a month in advance based on popular themes from previous months. This allows us to create quality content users can engage with because the data shows that’s what they are interested in.</li>
<li aria-level=""2"">Unlike Facebook and Twitter, Instagram posts are more about quality over quantity. Your followers can’t engage with your content if they don’t see it. Instagram uses an algorithm to decide which posts to show users, based on their interests. Spending more time creating quality posts will get more views, which in turn allows for more engagement.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">If Instagram posts are like blog posts, Instagram Stories are like tweets.</li>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""2"">For quick information you want to share, use Instagram Stories. They last for 24 hours and can reach a wider audience. An estimated 500 million people use Instagram Stories every day.</li>
<li aria-level=""2"">Although we plan our Instagram Stories campaigns a month in advance, we always leave room in the calendar for important topics that may arise and need immediate attention. For example, if there is a weather emergency or crisis, we include resources in our stories to quickly get the information out.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""2"">Keep information short and to the point. A good rule of thumb is to use the Twitter character count (about 140-280 characters). Stories move fast, so less text and more images capture people’s attention.</li>
<li aria-level=""2"">Always add a call to action in Instagram Stories. Your call to action should be related to your overall strategic plan. Is your goal to get more people to your website? To sign up for a newsletter? No matter what it is, at the end of every Instagram Story you post, link to your website or resource.</li>
</ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Consider themes and color schemes.&nbsp;</li>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""2"">Creating a lot of content can seem daunting, but if you create themes, it becomes easier. We have often run “mini-campaigns” where we focus on a theme for a week or two and post content related to that theme on Instagram Stories. Mini-campaigns that we’ve run include housing resources, back-to-school, and health topics.</li>
<li aria-level=""2"">To keep your content and page visually appealing, pick a color scheme that matches your website or logo. At USAGov, we use the blue and gray color scheme from our logo. When choosing what pictures to use, we tend to look for those that have a blue color scheme or apply the same filter to every photo. This creates a more cohesive look and fe<span style=""font-size: 17px;"">el.</span></li>
</ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Engage with your audience.</li>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""2"">Engaging with your audience does not have to be scary. Start off with yes/no polls or quizzes. As engagement grows, you can create a space for people to give you feedback. For example, we have done “trivia Tuesdays” or asked our followers to vote on “this or that.” Limiting choices leaves little room for trolls and spam.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Tag and use hashtags.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style=""list-style-type: none;"">
<ul>
<li aria-level=""2"">Just about everyone knows you should be using hashtags, but not everyone knows how to get the most from them. Did you know there are thousands of hashtags that have been banned temporarily or permanently from Instagram? Simple hashtags like #WorkFlow, #Books, and #Desk have all been banned at some point on Instagram.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""2"">When using hashtags, add around 5-10 and make them as specific to your post as possible. Also, consider using a hashtag generator to keep up with current trends.</li>
<li aria-level=""2"">A helpful strategy for us has been to tag local, state, and national agencies or organizations. With reshares from those organizations, our content has gotten more views and engagement, leading to increased partnerships.</li>

<p><!--more--></p>
<p>From summer 2019 to May 2020, I was a part-time virtual intern for <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/explore/""><span>USAGov</span></a>. It was through a GSA student employment opportunity from the Federal Acquisition Service’s Emerging Leaders Program. I was also a full-time student at George Washington University, majoring in international affairs. The things I learned from my experience during that busy year can help others who are beginning their careers.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> A schedule will be an intern’s best friend.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Having a calendar has never been so beneficial. It allowed me to prioritize, keep track of my weekdays, and manage my time more effectively. I learned that by putting my class schedule and work meetings on the same calendar, it helped me visualize at what times I needed to focus on being a student or employee. Calendars help structure your day and prevent you from spending too much time on one activity.</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li><strong> Avoid giving more assignments than an intern can handle.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to find the right balance of work and school. It’s better to give fewer assignments and add more as they’re completed. Check in to see if your intern is feeling overwhelmed or has too much work to do.&nbsp;</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li><strong> Maintain communication between supervisors, team members, and interns.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Communication is different when you’re working remotely. Although it was hard not being able to just quickly run something to my supervisors or colleagues in person, using email, chats, and virtual meetings allowed me to get the job done. It was important to be transparent with team members, letting them know what times I would be available and online. Daily stand-ups, one-on-one meetings, and group chats were great ways to keep in consistent contact with each other.&nbsp;</p>
<ol start=""4"">
<li><strong> Interns, procrastination will set you back.&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Procrastination will kill you. I have learned the hard way. It’s important to get your work done on time or you’ll find yourself staying up at night trying to finish it. Whenever I felt unmotivated to do work, I would stretch, grab a coffee, and find a comfortable quiet place where I could refocus and do my work.&nbsp;</p>
<ol start=""5"">
<li><strong> Create a good support system.&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A good support system is an important foundation for an intern’s performance. I was lucky to have a team and supervisors who were so supportive and understanding. My education was always a priority to me, and it was so beneficial for my supervisors to be flexible and allow me to fit my work schedule around my school schedule.&nbsp;</p>
<ol start=""6"">
<li><strong> Make it safe to ask questions.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Interns need encouragement to ask questions. It’s better to find out what an acronym stands for or what something means than to skip over it. As a good employee, it’s crucial to know what you’re working on and be engaged in all aspects. You never know when that unfamiliar term will show up again, so it’s better to ask sooner than later.&nbsp;</p>
<ol start=""7"">
<li><strong> Offer opportunities to take on different projects.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>An important part of an internship is the ability to explore new and different projects and roles. I had the opportunity to work in analyzing data, creating content, performing outreach, and conducting research. These projects helped me figure out what I enjoyed doing, and how I could grow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We showed participants Facebook and Twitter posts from the CDC, NOAA, and USA.gov. Five participants saw posts with <a href=""https://go.usa.gov/""><span>Go.USA.gov</span></a> short links and the other five saw posts with Bitly (bit.ly) short links.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We wanted to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>How they could tell if a social media account was officially from the government</li>
<li>What would make them hesitate to click a link in a social media post</li>
<li>If seeing “.gov” in a link made a difference</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What We Learned</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Participants spent 1-2 hours a day on Facebook and/or Twitter and had specific uses for each. They reported using Facebook for keeping up with their friends and family and being part of Facebook Groups. They used Twitter for getting the latest news, especially about the coronavirus, and other emergency updates.</li>
<li>Having an official logo and a verified social media account is important. Participants knew to look for the blue checkmark to verify that an account was the real thing.<br><br><em>“I would see the source and look at the comments and number of likes, then click on the account to look at the info.”</em> </li>
<li>Six of the ten participants would not click on or hesitated to click on bit.ly links.<br><br><em>“I think it (the post) is ok, but what concerns me is that it's a bit.ly link and I would not click on it. I don’t like link shorteners, don’t trust them.”</em></li>
<li>While participants were wary of bit.ly links, they did trust Go.USA.gov and other .gov links. All the participants said that they would click on a link, even if it’s a long link, if it had .gov in the domain. They knew they could trust the official nature of information with a .gov link.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>“Bit.ly can mask URLs. (But) you can see the true root of the URL with the .gov link.”</em><em><br></em></p>
<p>These findings will help our outreach team as it selects the types of links to use in our social media posts. They also show us that people pay attention to the authority of the social media accounts and posts they see.</p>",https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/532040/twitter_go.png,,PUBLISHED,true

<p>In early 2020, we audited the performance of our <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/usagov""><span>@USAGov Instagram</span></a> account to see what was going well and how we could do a better job of connecting people to government information and services. We analyzed the activity and metrics for the 141 Instagram posts we shared from February 2019 to February 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The audit taught us six important things about our @USAGov Instagram followers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>People engaged the most with our posts in the middle of the week. </strong>Our followers liked, shared, and commented the most on weekdays. We saw an average of three times more engagement on Tuesday and Thursday compared to Monday-Wednesday-Friday. And like our other social media platforms, we got the least interaction on Sunday. Knowing this helps us concentrate the bulk of our posts mid-week.</li>
<li><strong>Midday is the best time to post.</strong> Although most users are online from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, the best time to share posts on our account is during certain peak hours of engagement. Posting around 9:00 AM ET generates a lot of conversation and clicks as people often check their accounts first thing in the morning. Posting between 12:00 PM and 3:00 PM ET reaches the lunch or afternoon break crowd, while our west coast followers are beginning their day. In our next analysis, we’d like to learn more about how geography can help shape our posting strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Infographics are more popular than we thought. </strong>At first glance, posts highlighting infographics didn’t seem as successful because they had fewer likes and comments. But when we looked deeper, we realized they attracted more viewers from the hashtags we used with them. And they received about ten times more shares and saves compared to non-infographic posts. Because they combine information and data in a visually compelling way, infographics are great for helping people remember a message. We’ll continue to use them in our Instagram strategy.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>It’s more valuable to spend time on stories than on videos. </strong>Video posts didn’t perform as well as we hoped. They received the fewest likes. We believe this might be because people are quickly browsing through the app and don’t slow down to watch our videos. With the amount of time and effort that goes into creating a video, the return on investment wasn’t worth it. Stories or image-based posts may be a better option for us.</li>
<li><strong>People engage with Instagram in different ways. </strong>On most social media platforms, people are able to like, comment, and share content. But Instagram is different. It also gives users the ability to save posts to revisit and to view stories for up to 24 hours. That gives us additional ways to identify the most relevant content and best topics to promote.</li>
<li><strong>Popular topics differ from our other social media platforms.</strong> The Instagram posts that received the most likes focused on history, holidays, health, and travel. These topics had images that were captivating, reminiscent, and engaging. On Facebook and Twitter, topics that receive the most attention are related to money, safety, passports, scams, and recalls--often much less visually interesting topics.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>As we continue to study our performance on Instagram and other social media platforms, we’re helping our <a href=""https://connect.usa.gov/digital-toolkit-levels-of-partnership""><span>agency partners</span></a> connect with their audiences.

To make sure we’re reaching the right people at the right time with valuable content, our team began to rethink our <a href=""https://twitter.com/USAGovEspanol"">USAGov en Español Twitter</a> strategy.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We’d noticed some decline in Twitter followers and started brainstorming how we could engage more people. We decided to focus on increasing the frequency and changing the timing of posts. We had been consistently posting once in the morning and once in the afternoon every day, often at 11:00 AM and 3:00 PM or 5:00 PM Eastern Time. By challenging this business-as-usual practice, we hypothesized that we could increase our weekly reach and maintain more followers.</p>
<p>User data showed our east coast-based team that a big part of our audience is actually based in California and Texas. So for our first month-long experiment, we came up with a new strategy. We posted each of three individual messages twice a day, for a total of six posts daily, at different times that were better for our western and southwestern followers. We analyzed the results and were shocked by the success of our simple experiment. Our weekly engagement increased by 110% and we were beginning to turn around the loss of followers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, we tried a slightly different tactic to reach all of our time zones. We continued to create three individual messages a day, but posted the most important message twice, for a total of four posts a day. We did this consistently for a couple of months and noticed that the outcome was very similar to our previous experiment, so it was not necessary to post 6 times a day as we’d previously done. It was more important to keep in mind that some key messages are better posted twice a day to reach people all over the country.</p>
<p>The main lesson we learned is that when we schedule Twitter messages, we have to think more about locations and time zones. In the meantime, we’re continuing to experiment, ask questions, and challenge our assumptions about the Spanish-speaking audience on Twitter.</p>",https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/532040/Screen%20Shot%202020-07-22%20at%208.51.49%20AM.png,,PUBLISHED,true

Once we launched the new English IVR, we saw how critical it was in helping us handle COVID-19-related call volume surges. And so we decided to tackle the Spanish-language call volume with its own updated IVR.</span></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: #000000;"">You might think that the best way to do it would be to simply translate the English messages into Spanish. Though that could be an easy approach, we have a lot of experience with our Spanish-speaking audience and knew the easy way wasn’t the </span><em><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: #000000;"">right way</span></em><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: #000000;""> to do it.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;"">English and Spanish speakers seek similar information on our websites and from our contact center. But there are significant differences as well. It’s always our goal to do the research so we meet the needs of the public. If we include menu options that aren’t top tasks, we make the experience more difficult for callers. And omitting information that’s important to this audience doesn’t help either. In short, there’s no “one size fits all” approach.</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;"">Spanish-language call and chat data told us that our top customer tasks are related to:&nbsp;</span></p>

</ul>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;"">These top-level tasks look very much like our English top tasks. But based on our data, we knew that we’d have to present menu options in a different order and address different sub-topics than we do in our English menu.</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;"">Using what we learned from our IVR best practices research and our customer call data, we began work on the IVR structure. The most popular topics appear as the first items in the menu, and each branch allows callers to repeat the options or return to the previous menu. Callers can only reach an agent from the main menu.</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;"">As we wrote the script, we discovered a challenge. We often give callers URLs to government websites they can refer to for more information. But some Spanish-language government sites have long URLs that are too complex and difficult to convey verbally. We can’t control the URLs other agencies use for their information, so we came up with our own solution. We created a web page on USAGov en Español with a simple URL that we give only to contact center callers. When they go to that URL, they can click a link to get to the agency web page they need. It’s not an ideal solution, but it’s a way that we can use resources under our control to make the journey a little easier for our callers.</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;"">Before launching the IVR, we did prototype testing with Spanish speakers. We wanted to ensure that the structure made sense to our callers and that the script clearly led people to the information they were looking for. How did we do it and what did we discover? Find out in an upcoming follow-up post.</span></p>",https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/Woman%20sending%20a%20text%20from%20her%20mobile%20phone%20reversed.jpg,,PUBLISHED,false

",2020-04-21 13:11:28,2020-04-21T13:11:28.930Z,"<p>Throughout USAGov’s history, we’ve relied on the expertise of federal agencies to help fulfill our mission of giving the public clear, accurate information about government services and programs. Connecting regularly keeps us up-to-date with agencies’ priorities and activities. We do this in many ways.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><strong>Introductory conversations</strong>: One-on-ones with agencies that haven’t partnered with us help us explain who we are, find out who they are, and learn what they’re looking for in a partnership. These are often set up through listservs, mutual connections, or <a href=""http://www.usa.gov/partnerships"">USAGov’s Partnership Toolkit</a>. Ultimately, we can <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/three-things-to-expect-from-a-partnership-with-usagov"">set expectations on what a partnership with us looks like</a> and define responsibilities to make this a mutually beneficial experience. Recently, we’ve had kick-off calls with teams at the Census Bureau and SSA’s Office of the Inspector General.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic sessions: </strong>One of the ways we stay connected with digital content and social media teams, communications and program staff, among others, is by hosting strategic sessions. These are opportunities to connect directly with subject matter experts, provide or receive an update on current agency priorities, and brainstorm ways to collaborate. We typically do these with one agency partner at a time, and focus on a single topic or campaign. A recent strategic session led to our National Consumer Protection Week campaign that reached hundreds of thousands of people through efforts including <a href=""https://twitter.com/USAGov/status/1234907157377748994"">a bilingual Twitter chat</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Roundtables</strong>: These round-robin-style meetings are a great way to incorporate multiple agencies in a conversation about USAGov partnership efforts or any other topic. We’re able to share updates on events we’ve hosted, and give agencies a platform to discuss their own successes, connect with others, and share best practices and pain points. Recent roundtables focused on how USAGov uses data to enhance our channels and ways the Spanish agency partner community can best collaborate.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In-person and virtual connections</strong>: Social distancing isn’t keeping us from making a meaningful connection with agency partners. In 2020 so far, we’ve had virtual meetings to connect both in planned conversations and on the fly. In the past, we’ve set whole afternoons to hash out month-long campaigns, discuss what went well and what didn’t, and just put faces to names across a conference table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even when we can’t meet in person, it’s important to set aside time to talk with our collaborators--from federal headquarters staff to small, regional communications teams--to create new opportunities to inform the people we serve.&nbsp;</p>

The blog goes into all the upgrades and updates that were added to make it more efficient.,2020-03-24 12:40:49,2020-03-24T12:40:49.866Z,"<p>A significant part of USAGov’s work is to answer the public’s questions about government through our <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/phone"">USAGov Contact Center</a>. In 2019, we received more than 430,000 calls. Our agents answered many requests for other agencies’ phone numbers and questions about the status of applications, payments, or personal information. We believed that we could answer these requests more efficiently by expanding our use of interactive voice response (IVR). An IVR is an automated system that routes callers on a phone tree, based on their voice responses or pressing a specific button on their phone keypad.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We’d only been using our IVR after hours. But by using automated messages during regular business hours too, we could maximize our resources. From a cost perspective, routing the more common and easy-to-answer questions through the IVR could reduce call volume and the related costs. Calls that did come to our agents would be ones that required more nuanced responses, where they could offer more value.</p>
<p>In October 2019, we started the process of creating our new IVR with research. We learned from:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Private sector IVR best practices</li>
<li>Other federal government agency IVR menus</li>
<li>Our internal contact center data</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on our research, we designed an IVR that’s informative, yet concise. We limited the main menu to five topics. Based on our contact center data, we arranged the order so the most popular topics, taxes and passports, were mentioned at the beginning of the menu. We also created messages for immigration issues, housing, and government benefits. Each branch allows callers to repeat the options or return to the previous menu. Callers can only reach an agent from the main menu.</p>
<p>Once we created the structure for the IVR, we began working with our telecom vendor to get price estimates for restructuring the call menu. This included voice talent to record the messages and testing. Our team was able to expedite the process so the new IVR could go live as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other team members drafted a script based on the new structure. We tried to adhere to IVR best practices, keeping each answer brief. Our final script followed a pattern: state the topic or problem to be solved, name the government agency or program that could answer the question, and provide its URL and/or phone number.</p>
<p>Before launching the IVR, we tested it out on real people. How did we do it and what did we discover? Find out in an upcoming follow-up post.</p>",https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/Stock%20images/Woman%20reading%20on%20her%20mobile%20phone%20and%20smiling.jpeg,,PUBLISHED,false

<p><strong>Who uses the dashboard?</strong></p>
<p>Other federal agencies, GSA staff, and the general public are all potential audiences. By reviewing the dashboard, other agencies can quickly see if any topics relevant to their programs are ranking highly on USA.gov and USA.gov/espanol. This can help them know which information to promote or make more accessible to their users.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How was the dashboard created?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We modeled the USAGov dashboard after the government-wide <a href=""https://analytics.usa.gov/"">analytics.usa.gov</a> dashboard, created by GSA’s <a href=""https://digital.gov/guide/dap/"">Digital Analytics Program (DAP)</a>. Our developer used their open-source project to build USAGov’s dashboard. You can find the <a href=""https://github.com/18F/analytics.usa.gov"">code for analytics.usa.gov</a> and the <a href=""https://github.com/18F/analytics-reporter"">code behind the data collection</a> on GitHub. Since USA.gov and USA.gov/espanol link to other government websites, our developer revised the code to show top external links rather than downloads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our dashboard reflects data from a parallel Google Analytics account that matches pageview hits from DAP. We used our own account so we could isolate data for only USA.gov and USA.gov/espanol rather than pull in data for all GSA websites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We like the quick “who, what, and where” information the dashboard gives us about our users. And we’re looking forward to sharing more data with government agencies in the future.&nbsp;</p>

Upon reviewing, we were able to learn a lot about the bot and how people interacted with Artificial Intelligence in general.   ",2019-11-19 19:03:41,2019-11-19T19:06:46.925Z,"<p>Earlier this year, we piloted <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/breaking-into-artificial-intelligence-meet-sam-the-chatbot"">our USAGov chatbot</a> to help visitors find answers to their questions about scams and fraud. After the launch, we <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/our-first-round-of-updates-to-the-usagov-chatbot-v-1.2"">made tweaks to the interface</a> based on customer feedback and usage data.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more--><p>Curious to see how people were interacting with the technology, this summer, we spoke with a diverse group of nine English-speaking users and watched them try out the chatbot. They taught us a lot about our chatbot specifically, and about how people interact with AI in general.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Every single person had a scam story to tell.</h3>
<ul>
<li>I bet you do too. Here’s my favorite quote about it: “Well, everybody tries to scam me. It’s called the internet.”</li>
<li>Through the calls we get to our contact center and searches on our websites, we know how common scams are today. It really reinforces how important it is to give people an easy way to learn about and report scams.</li>
</ul>
<h3>People are familiar—and comfortable—with web chat.</h3>
<ul>
<li>All of our participants had used web chat before. They see it as an increasingly common feature for interacting with retailers and service providers.</li>
<li>People had mixed feelings about chatting with a bot and said they prefer to chat with a person. They’ve chatted with bots before, and sometimes the results have been good. But sometimes it’s been a waste of time. The outcome really depends on the complexity of the question, and the quality of the AI.</li>
<li>People don’t mind interacting with a bot initially. In fact, they expect it. They also expect to have an easy way to talk to a person if the bot can’t handle their question.</li>
</ul>
<h3>People like web chat more than the phone for simple questions.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Many said they actively avoid calling on the phone for help.</li>
<li>They really dislike lengthy IVRs, those recordings you hear when calling for service (“press 1 for billing questions,” etc.).&nbsp;</li>
<li>Waiting for a long time in a call queue is unpleasant, and based on their prior experiences, that’s what they expect.</li>
<li>Having their call transferred from person to person and having to explain their situation over and over feels like a frustrating waste of time.</li>
<li>A number of participants said that they just don’t like talking to agents on the phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>But chat offers flexibility. They can multitask while getting an answer to their question.</p>
<h3>The USAGov chatbot was very helpful for some tasks, less so for others.</h3>
<ul>
<li>When they were given a clear, discrete task, like finding out where to report a scam, they found the bot very useful. In this case, it was a simple question and our bot returned a simple answer with a clear call to action.&nbsp;</li>
<li>When they were given a more nuanced question, like how to determine if something was a real scam or just a rumor, the bot was less helpful. With AI, the quality of your service can only be as good as the information it has to work with.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Should the chatbot have a name?</h3>
<p>Many chatbots have their own persona and a name. Ours does not; it’s simply the USAGov Chatbot. We’ve been toying with the idea of creating a chatbot persona, and people had mixed feelings about that idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most people preferred the current name, “USAGov Chatbot” because:</p>
<ul>
<li>“USAGov Chatbot” clearly describes the service.</li>
<li>A human name is misleading. It gives you the expectation that you’ll be chatting with a real person, and that’s not the case.</li>
<li>Making it sound “cute” undermines the credibility and the authoritative nature of a government service. Remember, we’re talking about people who have just been scammed. They’re wary of being scammed again.</li>
<li>If we wanted to give it a name, they suggested names like “Sam” (representing Uncle Sam), “George” (for George Washington), and “Rob” (short for Robot).</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, user research was valuable. They gave us good ideas for simple and immediate improvements, like making our chatbot responses more actionable, and adding tooltips to our “start a new chat” icon. We also have things we can consider as we plan for our AI future.</p>",https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/Blog_Chatbot_Image.png,,PUBLISHED,false

",2019-09-23 15:10:00,2023-06-15T15:11:08.277Z,"<p>When it comes to writing content for the web, we can’t ignore Search Engine Optimization (SEO). It doesn’t matter how great your content is if the user can’t find it quickly. That’s why a good relationship between SEO and content is key to improve content visibility.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here are some of the SEO content writing techniques that we use at USAGov that can help position your content higher on the Search Engine Result Pages (SERP).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Figure out the user intent:</strong> A person visiting your site might want to know or do something or go somewhere in particular. Once you have an idea of the need you want to fulfill and what the user journey might be, it’s easier to do an outline of your new content.<span><br></span></li>
<li><strong>Stand out:</strong> Keep in mind that you should offer some extra value to your readers. Is there any service or information that <i>only you</i> can provide?<span><br></span></li>
<li><strong>Keep your topics relevant:</strong> Use specific terms that people will use to search for that topic in the title of your page. Also use those keywords and some variations of them in the meta description and on other parts of the page to tie the topic together. Ideally, your keywords should feel natural in your writing. For example, someone may search for “food stamps” or “food help” rather than knowing the name of a specific program like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.<span><br></span></li>
<li><strong>Write content for a wide audience:</strong> Make sure the language is neither too simple nor full of complicated terms. At USAGov, we strive to write at a 7th grade level so that our content is easy to understand -- both by our users and search engines.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure your content can be scanned quickly.</strong> Short paragraphs, clear headings, bold text, bullet points and numbered lists make the text easy on the eyes. Search engines also favor content that is well-structured. Stay away from long paragraphs and sentences. Users tend to get lost in them, especially if they are on a mobile device.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Make sure the content provides a complete answer:</strong> When you start writing, refer back to your research on your user’s intent (from tip #1). Make sure your content addresses all the key questions&nbsp; your audience is seeking help with, and make sure that you answer them. You may consider highlighting related questions under new subheadings to make them more clear to your user and the search engine. This will align your content with the users needs.</li>
<li><strong>Think mobile:</strong> Nearly any type of content you develop may be viewed on a mobile device, and building a strong user experience requires you to make sure it is ready for this Google also now favors mobile-friendly content in its search results, so designing content for mobile is good for search algorithms and your user experience.
<ul>
<li>Try to make your content scrollable instead of forcing people to click through multiple pages, which can be challenging on mobile.</li>
<li>Make sure any videos on your pages are compatible with smart devices.</li>
<li>Make sure any buttons on the screen are big enough for mobile customers to use.</li>
</ul>
</li>

It not only provides a better experience for the user, but also shows there are real people working hard behind an organization. With that in mind, here are some tips to create, edit and share your videos:</p>
<p><strong>Know Your Audience</strong></p>
<p>Determine the audience you want to reach. Learning from them will help you create a successful long-term strategy. Once you have this, you will be able to develop relevant, interesting, and valuable video content for your digital channels.</p>
<p><strong>Customize Your Account</strong></p>
<p>Avoid stock images; try using original content as much as you can. Style goes beyond text. If your brand uses certain colors or even a tone try to follow it. Make sure everything looks personalized, eye-catching, relevant, and engaging.</p>
<p><strong>Find the Right Equipment for You</strong></p>
<p>You may think developing a video is an expensive task to tackle. However, you only need an internet connection and a smartphone to create something. Not everything has to be broadcast TV quality. Simple video content performs well on social media. While it’s good to splurge on equipment, if you can, don’t let it stop you from creating useful and fun videos.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Keep Accessibility in Mind</strong></p>
<p>Make sure your content is available for people with disabilities. Make accessibility part of your creative process from the start and talk about it with your team. <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/figuring-out-508-5-insights-on-accessibility"">Check out five insights </a>from our team to get started.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Practice, Evaluate and Iterate&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>At USAGov, this is something we take very seriously. By constantly testing and practicing, we’ve been able to improve the quality of our products. What we learned after <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/facebook-live-how-we-do-it-and-what-we-learned-in-year-one"">doing Facebook Lives for a year</a> is the need to constantly evaluate our processes as well as the quality and impact of our video content.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Be Perseverant</strong></p>
<p>Perseverance will be the key to your success. The more often you create, the more attention you will garner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't forget to interact with your audience directly once you post your videos on your digital channels; read their comments, answer their questions, perform live events, and listen to them. Their feedback, along with performance data, will provide you with the roadmap you need for a bright future.</p>
<p><strong>Ready to Start?</strong></p>
<p>Keep these pointers in mind if you’re ready to dip your toes in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to capture the viewer's attention in the first few seconds, even before the sound is activated.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Don’t go too long. You might run the risk of losing viewers early on.</li>
<li>Optimize for specific platforms. For social media for example, keep videos near the minute mark.&nbsp;</li>

<!--more--><p>As technology makes it easier than ever to find an answer to a question, our users have increasingly higher expectations of the services and information we deliver. As a result, we’ve pivoted our approach to producing content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of writing content, we now design content!&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s the difference you might ask? Sarah Richards, the former head of content design for the Government Digital Service in the UK, describes it best in her blog post <a href=""https://contentdesign.london/content-design/content-design-vs-editorial/"">Content Design vs Editorial</a>:</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 18px; text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><em>If you approach a new piece of web content with ‘how shall I write this?’, that’s writing or editorial. If you approach it from ‘how am I going to get this across to the audience in the best way possible?’, that’s content design.</em></span></h3>
<p>That shift might seem small and subtle, but it fundamentally changes the way we think about presenting content. We look at our data more closely. We spend time learning from our users about what they need to know about a topic and how they want that information delivered. We marry some of the most basic UX principles with content creation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Content design opens new possibilities of presenting answers in ways that we hadn’t considered before. It lets us think about how we adapt a piece of content to work for one of our call center agents or how we design an answer so that it reads easily on a mobile device. Content design is also creating possibilities for us to make it easier to adapt our content to new technologies like voice search.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re still continuing to execute on our mission of meeting users where they are, but as the speed of information flow continues to increase with new technologies, content design lets us deliver better on that mission.</p>",https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/contentaudit.jpg,,PUBLISHED,true

",2019-08-06 13:27:36,2019-08-06T15:25:02.962Z,"<p>Earlier this year, we shared a <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/asking-more-about-our-email-audience-2018-survey-project-process-part-1"">blog post</a> about our methods for surveying our bilingual email subscribers. We wanted to learn more about our users, their needs and preferences, to serve them better. <!--more-->The data analysis happened in two phases. In phase one, we focused on a high level summary of over 9,600 survey responses. And in the second phase, we explored areas that warranted a deeper analysis, such as how different subtopics interacted and the main characteristics of those who subscribe to our business list.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Phase I - High Level Summary&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>Phase I offered a snapshot of our USAGov email subscribers. We learned that the respondents generally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prefer to receive emails weekly&nbsp;</li>
<li>Are 55+</li>
<li>Use USAGov emails to help themselves</li>
</ul>
<p><img src=""https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/hh.png"" alt=""hh"" width=""548"" style=""width: 548px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;""></p>
<p>From the survey responses, our vocal subscribers seem relatively established in their lives.&nbsp; Most aren’t interested in housing topics, like shopping for a mortgage or landlord complaints, maybe because 45% already own homes. Another 45% identified as retirees, so information about running a business or finding a job might not be of interest to this group. 11% are parents of school-aged children, so those respondents may&nbsp; not be concerned about education information for young children. Overall, 83% of those who responded to our survey have attended college, and almost half had earned at least a bachelor’s degree. These inferences from the survey responses allow us to shape how we present our email content and find ways to communicate to the people identified beyond an email address.</p>
<p><strong>Phase II - a Deeper Dive&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>The high level analysis ultimately made us curious to learn more about specific areas and dive into subsets of information from the questions asked. To best engage with our email subscribers, we sought out to learn more about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business-related email content and those subscribers&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Topic overlaps - cross-sections within our subject areas, such as health, benefits, and education information.</li>
<li>Overlap of roles - the instances when a respondent identified in multiple roles, such as a veteran who is also a homeowner and teacher.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in 2015, we inherited a subscriber list from Business.USA.gov, when the website shut down. This survey was our first chance to learn more about this subset of followers. We’d made the assumption that most business management subscribers own businesses. But from the survey, we found that only 30% of business management subscribers own a business, most of which have been operational for at least one year. Now that we know, we can better address the needs of prospective and actual owners, share content to help nascent businesses stay afloat and aspiring owners understand business loans or steps to starting a company.</p>
<p>Additionally almost 90% of our subscribers want information about multiple topics. The most common combinations include government benefits, disasters and emergencies, and health.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/ff.png"" alt=""ff"" width=""544"" style=""width: 544px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;""></p>
<p>Similarly, we learned that 75% of subscribers identify with multiple roles. A key consideration from our analysis of overlapping roles is the need to balance audience size and interest. For example, 575 respondents identified as both parents and homeowners. In our dataset, those 575 people comprise over 53% of parents, but only 13% of homeowners. Scenarios like these remind us to leverage these role overlaps to share government information where it will yield the strongest impact, based on our reach and engagement goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/gg.png"" alt=""gg"" width=""567"" style=""width: 567px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;""></p>

We’ll use these findings to adjust how we frame topics, based on our users’ preferences. These results challenged some assumptions we’ve held about our subscribers. Now we have data to ground changes, like splitting some subscriber lists and clarifying our topic buckets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a partnership perspective, these findings will allow us to bring more insights to conversations with other agencies. The information from the email surveying exercise has value beyond the “walls” of USAGov. To that end, we’ll look for opportunities to share these findings with others, both internal and external to GSA.</p>","https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/Mail,%20speech%20bubbles,%20mobile%20phone%20icons%20by%20the%20word%20_feedback_%20with%20a%20computer%20in%20the%20background.jpg",,PUBLISHED,false

",2019-07-23 17:20:47,2023-04-18T13:47:10.200Z,"<p>The USAGov team plays a challenging, but important role in times of national disaster in helping people across the country prepare for and recover from disasters. To do this, we use different tactics across our channels to ensure we are delivering accurate, helpful information to those who needed it most.</p>
<p><!--more--><span style=""background-color: transparent;"">Here are some implementable tips we have learned to ensure you have the resources and tactics as an organization, federal agency, or media outlet to deliver timely information:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ask your visitors and followers to sign up for emergency alerts</strong>: To ensure those across the country stay aware, urge your followers to sign up for emergency alerts. They can learn what different types of warning alert systems are available to have on their devices in preparation for a natural disaster or emergency. <a href=""https://www.ready.gov/alerts"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">These text messages, apps, and radio alerts can help anyone have the most updated information available to them.</a></li>
<li><strong>Have a content bank ready to go</strong>: Our organization relies on information developed and shared by agency partners before, during and after an emergency situation. Here are a few of our favorites that include emergency alert sign ups, apps to use on the fly, and storm predictions:</li>
<ol>
<li><a href=""https://www.ready.gov/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ready.gov</a> - A public service campaign run through Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) with specific storm pages like <a href=""https://www.ready.gov/hurricanes"" rel=""noopener"">hurricanes</a> and <a href=""https://www.ready.gov/earthquakes"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">earthquakes</a> that include before, during, and after tips.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/disaster-distress-helpline"">Disaster Distress Hotline</a> - A confidential emotional support hotline run by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration available by phone at 1-800-985-5990 or by texting ""TalkWithUs"" to 66746.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/"">The National Hurricane Center</a> - Live maps from the National Weather Service including active storms, week-out projections, and rainfall/flood predictions.</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.usa.gov/disasters-and-emergencies"">USAGov Disaster page</a> - our own summary page updated with information based on specific storms as well as general financial, safety, and preparation links and services.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<li><strong>Follow FEMA accounts</strong>: FEMA shares timely information that people impacted by disasters need. Follow and constantly check social media accounts for immediate updates as a storm develops. FEMA HQ is on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/FEMA/"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/fema/?hl=en"">Instagram</a> and <a href=""http://twitter.com/fema"">Twitter</a>, and has additional accounts across the 10 regions and sub-programs like Ready.gov.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure content is accessible even if there are connectivity issues</strong>: During emergencies, it is very common for areas to have reduced connectivity. Make sure to share information that doesn’t take long to load or requires a strong internet connection. For example,&nbsp; include key information that the public needs to access on the post itself. Don’t make them have to click on a link to get the most essential information as connectivity might be an issue. Don’t rely just on graphics and videos to convey your key messages. People might have problems loading those.</li>
<li><strong>Think about different audiences</strong>: Emergencies can impact all kinds of people. Keep in mind parents caring for young children, <a href=""https://www.ready.gov/pets"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">pet owners</a>, senior citizens, limited-English proficient individuals and caregivers, among many others. Creating messaging for different demographic groups and those in various geographic areas means the right people can get the right information to keep themselves safe.</li>

Our history has been full of change, and never static as we improve people’s lives by connecting them with the government services and information they need.<br><!--more--></p>
<p>USAGov grew from the consumer movement of the 1960s. It was the era of activists and federal programs joining forces to protect people from dishonest ads and unsafe products. That partnership also unearthed a discovery: agencies had an abundance of consumer information, but no system for sharing it. A cross-agency committee persuaded President Nixon to address the problem. In 1970, he established the Consumer Product Information Coordinating Center within the General Services Administration. It was a big name for that tiny team of go-getters. Their mission was a big one too: collaborate with agencies to gather all that consumer information and get it to the people.</p>
<h3><strong>Print: High Tech, 70s-Style</strong></h3>
<p>Over the years, our name changed. And in the beginning, the program known today as USAGov found that the best way to educate people was through printed publications. Lots of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We helped scores of agencies develop and promote publications on money, health, federal benefits, scams, and more. They appeared in USAGov’s <i>Consumer Information Catalog</i>, a quarterly listing of more than 200 free and low-cost publications. The <i>Catalog</i> was so popular that by 1973, we’d outgrown our local GSA warehouse. Distribution moved to the Government Publishing Office’s center in Pueblo, Colorado. To keep up with the growth, Pueblo got us our own zip code and mail trucks. We also shared some pop culture fame. In 1975, USAGov started using the Pueblo name, the <i>Catalog</i>, and other USAGov services in a series of public service print and TV ads spanning 35 years. As a result, one in five people surveyed nationwide recognized Pueblo as the home of government booklets. By the time we <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/change-comes-to-usagovs-historic-publication-program"">turned over full operation of the publication program to GPO</a> in 2016, USAGov received 76 million orders for 1.2 billion publications.</p>
<img src=""https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/Public%20service%20print%20ad%201980.jpg"" alt=""Public service print ad 1980"" width=""300"" style=""width: 300px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;"">
<p>The <i>Catalog’s</i> most popular publication was the <i>Consumer Action Handbook. </i>We published it, as well as its Spanish counterpart, the <i>G</i><i>uía del Consumidor</i> until 2018. Both books’ essential features, including a sample complaint letter and tips to save money and avoid scams, are now on USAGov’s websites.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Entering the Digital Age</strong></h3>
<p>USAGov debuted one of the first government bulletin board systems in 1992. This precursor to the internet allowed anyone with a modem to dial a GSA server in Washington to read or download electronic versions of the publications listed in the <i>Catalog</i>.</p>
<p>Two years later, people were beginning to discover the internet. And we were with them from the start with <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/19961222151635/http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov:80/"">pueblo.gsa.gov</a>. The homespun site drew more than a million visits its first year. It was eventually replaced by Publications.USA.gov, which GPO now operates as the <a href=""https://pueblo.gpo.gov/"">Pueblo.GPO.gov</a> U.S. Government Bookstore.</p>
<p>In 2002, we began managing <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/"">USA.gov</a>, the federal government’s official website. Originally named FirstGov.gov, the site debuted two years earlier when an internet entrepreneur gifted a search engine to the government. In 2003, its Spanish counterpart, <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/espanol/"">USAGov en español</a> (formerly GobiernoUSA.gov) came on the scene. Both sites help people easily connect with programs, services, and information from across federal, state, and local government. Time Magazine named USA.gov one of the “25 Websites We Can’t Live Without.”</p>
<p>Over the years, we’ve managed a variety of other websites, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kids.gov - The government’s official website for children debuted in 2001 in response to a White House executive order. It connected families and teachers with fun and educational information from across government.</li>
<li>HowTo.gov - The one-stop resource for government web professionals, in the early 2010s, it spun off and became the <a href=""https://digital.gov/"">DigitalGov</a> program.</li>
<li><a href=""https://vote.gov/"">Vote.gov</a> - Created in 2016 with the help of our sibling program, <a href=""https://18f.gsa.gov/"">18F</a>, Vote.gov gives citizens a simple way to find out how to register to vote in their state. Under USAGov’s management, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation named it the #1 federal website.</li>
</ul>
<p>By 2013, a third of the U.S. had turned to mobile devices as their exclusive way to access the internet. USAGov met them there with a new responsive design. It scales to deliver the same content in the right format for computers, smartphones, tablets, and any future mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Outreach Through Social Media and Email</strong></h3>
<p>We’ve experimented with every major social media platform and find that bilingual <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/USAgov/"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/USAGovEspanol"">Twitter</a> accounts work well for us. Both platforms let us hear directly from and give answers to our followers. They’re also effective platforms for cross-agency partnerships. With an audience of nearly one million social followers, our experience helps us design, produce and host <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/facebook-live-how-we-do-it-and-what-we-learned-in-year-one"">Facebook Live events</a> and Twitter chats that are informative and interactive.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""background-color: transparent; font-size: 17px;"">Our social media event partners include the Federal Trade Commission, the Small Business Adm</span><span style=""background-color: transparent; font-size: 17px;"">inistration, the Social Security Administration, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.</span></p>
<p>We also support agencies through our <a href=""https://connect.usa.gov/subscribe"">email marketing program</a>, serving nearly one million subscribers. The carefully-crafted messages feature engaging images and compelling calls to action that connect recipients with information on recalls, resources geared to current events, government services and more.</p>
<h3><strong>The Contact Center and Human Connection</strong></h3>
<p>Even with a strong web and mobile presence, we recognize that sometimes, it’s easier to talk to a real, live person. USAGov met that need when we began managing the Federal Information Center in 2000. Part of GSA since 1966, the FIC ran a nationwide network of phone-in and walk-up contact centers to guide people, one-on-one, to the right government program to answer their questions. Today, the bilingual service is known as the USAGov Contact Center. It offers a <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/chat"">web chat service</a> and takes calls from the public at 1-844-USA-GOV1. In addition to helping USAGov users, the center also serves federal partners including the State Department, Login.gov, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Fish and Wildlife Service.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Guiding People Through Change and Times of Trouble&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>USAGov is America’s guide through changing times. From the inflation and energy crises of the 1970s to health issues including AIDS and Zika virus, to the introduction of personal computers and mobile devices, we’ve given people advice they could trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the terror attacks of 9/11, people have relied on the contact center and our digital channels during emergencies. The Department of Homeland Security now designates USAGov as the official channel of disaster communications to the public for the federal government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the 2017 devastation of Hurricane Maria, USAGov team members in DC and on the scene with FEMA in Puerto Rico <a href=""https://digital.gov/event/2018/01/09/responding-to-a-disaster-how-usagov-helped-shape-the-digital-response-in-puerto-rico/"">created response strategies</a> using social media. They <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/when-collaborating-with-influencers-becomes-a-life-saving-tactic"">targeted influencers</a> to connect those affected by the hurricane with critical survival and recovery information.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>2019 and Beyond: USAGov is Always on the Move</strong></h3>
<p>After five decades, USAGov is still experimenting. We’re currently investigating new ways to make our content easier to find and use in major search engines. And we’ve been busy exploring artificial intelligence with the bilingual <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/breaking-into-artificial-intelligence-meet-sam-the-chatbot"">USAGov chatbot</a>. Currently, it gives users a personalized experience in learning about consumer scams. But this is just the beginning. Later, the chatbot will cover more topics and integrate with our contact center. It’s another step toward making our websites and other digital channels increasingly interactive and focused on top tasks and transactions.</p>
<p><img src=""https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/The%20USAGov%20chatbot--ready%20to%20answer%20your%20questions%20about%20scams.jpg"" alt=""The USAGov chatbot--ready to answer your questions about scams"" width=""512"" style=""width: 512px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;""></p>
<p>From the start, USAGov has been the central, official source of government information and services for the public. By compiling topical information from multiple agencies, we give people a more complete understanding of how their government works. We create opportunities to share data and lessons with agencies to help influence the way they provide their own public experience. And by listening together as an office to calls coming into our contact center, we develop insight and empathy for the people who come to us for help.

",2019-06-28 14:06:28,2019-07-29T19:05:52.692Z,"<p>One of the 2018 goals for our email outreach efforts was to learn more about our audience. Though in the past we had performed different exercises to do so -- email-level data analysis, content testing, and persona development to name a few -- we decided nothing beats being able to ask questions directly to our subscribers. <!--more--></p>
<p>So we began to explore how to survey our email audience of 915,000.</p>
<p>We worked with <a href=""https://oes.gsa.gov/"">GSA’s Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES</a>), a group of behavioral science and analysis experts, to harness their expertise of behavioral science best practices and learn more about the choices and behaviors our specific audience takes. These were our goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a survey that clearly asks our subscribers for their interests and goals when it comes to following our brand.</li>
<li>Learn more about the business subscriber list we inherited a few years ago from the Department of Commerce.</li>
<li>Test if different templates of an email influence a subscriber’s decision to take or not take a survey we send.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>To survey the general public like this, you must go through Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) approval process. This ensures information collected from the public is handled well.&nbsp; It requires getting clearance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</p>
<p>Surveying our email subscribers involved this unfamiliar approval process and new tools and approaches to managing data. OES helped us with context around the PRA process, develop questions to ask our email subscribers and optimized the survey through Qualtrics, a mobile and desktop friendly data analysis system. Additionally, the team helped us randomize our email subscribers into lists through our marketing automation tool. After the survey development was complete and the approvals were in place, we had a strategy that included:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 7-question bilingual survey</li>
<li>8 distinct email templates (four in both English and Spanish) with different formats, images, and Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons</li>
<li>16 randomized lists with varying engagement, language, and business list subscription</li>
</ul>

<p>We sent this survey out to our subscribers in September 2018 and got thousands of responses in both English and Spanish. In an upcoming blog, we will discuss the high level trends, what we learned, and how we will use this anonymous data to share better information with the public.&nbsp;</p>

But the number of list subscribers isn’t the only metric to track.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p><span>Engagement rates, like&nbsp;</span><a class=""external-link"" href=""https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/glossary/email-open-rate/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">open rates</a><span> </span><span>and&nbsp;</span><a class=""external-link"" href=""https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/glossary/click-through-rate-ctr/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">click-through rates</a><span>, are important metrics and tracking them can tell you how engaged and interested your audience is in your content.</span></p>
<p>Over time if lists become too big, engagement rates can drop. At this point, many communicators recommend conducting a<span>&nbsp;</span><a class=""external-link"" href=""https://www.stirista.com/blog/email-hygiene-definition-best-practices-and-services/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">list hygiene effort</a>, which is the process of refining and cleaning your email lists to remove inactive subscribers.</p>
<p>To learn more about how and why organizations should clean up their email lists, we interviewed Claire Loxsom, Email and Partnerships Lead for GSA’s USAGov Outreach Team. Regardless of the size of your organization, the following tips can help you navigate your own list hygiene process.</p>
<p><strong>HIV.gov:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>What exactly is “list hygiene”?</p>
<p><strong>Claire:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>List hygiene is taking stock of your current email subscriber lists and making the decision to clean up your list using techniques that are both informed by your data and driven by your content strategy. This includes removing those who have become less engaged, those subscribed to content you no longer share, and those who may not be the right audience anymore due to changes in your internal goals and priorities.</p>
<p><strong>HIV.gov:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Why do organizations need to take on a list hygiene effort?</p>
<p><strong>Claire:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>List cleanups allow organizations to target and serve the right content to subscribers in the right way. By cleaning out those who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>less interested in your content, you can focus on those who are engaged and be able to analyze trends in content engagement, peak time of interest, etc., with your strongest audience.</p>
<p><strong>HIV.gov:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>What are the benefits to list hygiene?</p>
<p><strong>Claire:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>We see two major benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keeping your lists relevant and lean. Think: quality over quantity!</li>
<li>Updating and accessing tried-and-true content with an active audience.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>HIV.gov:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>How does someone get started?</p>
<p><strong>Claire:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Define your goals for your list hygiene effort. For example, our email subscribers are organized into many topic lists, and our mission is to reach audiences with government information through link opens and click-throughs. Thus, we may focus on refining a certain topic-area audience, such as Money &amp; Shopping, by what we define as “reached” vs. “unreached.”</p>
<p>Our current data-analysis tool captures many data points from our email sends, such as who opened, who clicked, and who ignored our emails. There is a defined measurement that someone who hasn’t clicked or opened an email in the last 15 emails we’ve sent is inactive.</p>
<p>Be sure to involve a re-engagement campaign as an element of your list hygiene. Following data is a great source of understanding, but asking your subscribers directly if they’d like to continue receiving your information can be just as, if not more, powerful. Start with those who haven’t responded or engaged with your sends in a set period of time, and allow them time to say “Yes, keep me subscribed” or “No, let me go” in some recorded fashion. To explore our experience with this process, feel free to explore our blog post “<a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/letting-go-of-8525-of-our-email-subscribers"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Letting Go of 85% of Our Email Subscribers</a>”! Start incrementally, and be okay with this process (depending on your list size) at least once a year. It is okay to remove a little as you further define your needs. For example, in our last list hygiene exercise, we removed about 250,000 subscribers from three large lists (Money &amp; Shopping, Parents, and Teachers) from the over 1 million contacts subscribed to USAGov. Though this was a large number, in comparison to the total, we purged less than 25 percent of our subscribers, and increased our engagement numbers due to a much more focused total audience.</p>
<p><strong>HIV.gov:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>What advice do you have for this process?</p>
<p><strong>Claire:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Don’t be afraid to push the big delete button! It is great to approach this process incrementally, as list hygiene can be very intimidating. Of course, you don’t want to delete too many people, but you can switch your mindset to make this less intimidating: Know that having a large list of subscribers is nothing compared to a smaller list of engaged subscribers. Engagement can be a true testament to how content is performing, and how your creative decisions are paying off.</p>

<ul>
<li>We changed a word in our opening message directing people to “select” an option instead of “tap” a button. A tip of the hat to our pal Jeffrey Levy over at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) who reminded us that only people using the chatbot on a mobile device could physically “tap” a choice.</li>
<li>We removed “What’s the status of my scam complaint” from the bot’s welcome message. Our data showed us that almost none of our users were interested in that information. We removed it so there were fewer choices and people could more easily find what they really needed from the bot.</li>
<li>We added the option for people to tell us if the bot is helpful or not and how we could make it better. We’re excited to see what kind of feedback we get and continue to learn from our users throughout this process.</li>
<li>We’re working with our user experience team to set up some live user testing over the next several weeks so we can observe how people interact with the bot on a desktop or mobile device. This testing will help us prioritize our next batch of updates to the chatbot.</li>

USAGov Blog,Researching and Implementing Sticky Navigation in USAGov,Researching and Implementing Sticky Navigation in USAGov,en,/blog/2019/05/researching-and-implementing-sticky-navigation-in-usagov,Claire Loxsom,"Content,Performance and Analytics,User Experience and Accessibility",The USAGov UX team shares regular updates made to our sites based on data and testing.,2019-05-03 15:03:00,2023-06-15T15:04:03.253Z,"<p><a href=""http://www.usa.gov/"">USAGov</a> and <a href=""http://www.usa.gov/espanol"">USAGov en Español</a> offer a wide range of government information and services organized by topics to make it easy for people to find what they’re looking for. But navigating through different sections within our sites could be challenging and overwhelming for our visitors, especially first-time users.</p>
<p><!--more-->During user testing, we’ve seen that people sometimes miss key navigational links when trying to find information on a long page. As they scroll down the page, it becomes challenging to easily and quickly find related topics or key links located at the very top of the page. It’s also a common problem for our mobile users. So we decided to explore new ways to improve the user experience when navigating through all the different topics and services on our sites.</p>
<p>We know the importance of having quick access to navigation areas and how helpful it is for our visitors. Whether they explore the main topics or use the search engine, making those key areas visible at all times would reduce the amount of time and frustration for users completing a specific search.</p>
<p>A few months ago, the USAGov User Experience team began studying the concept of sticky navigation for our websites. The team conducted research and usability tests before implementing these new navigational elements on our sites.</p>
<h3>What is Sticky Navigation?</h3>
<p>Sticky or fixed navigation is a website menu that is locked into place so it doesn’t disappear when the user scrolls down the page. In other words, it’s accessible from anywhere on the website without having to scroll.</p>
<h3>Steps We Took in Exploring This Concept</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reviewed outside research - </strong>We read research on the effectiveness of sticky navigation. Some of the overall conclusions were:
<ol>
<li>Sticky menus are quicker to navigate and can cut up to 36 seconds off a five-minute visit to a website.</li>
<li>Participants preferred sticky menus without knowing why. They said that a website with sticky navigation was easier or faster to use.</li>
<li>Sticky navigation is ideal for long pages. It helps visitors make a smooth journey through content.</li>
<li>It works best with specific demographics. Sticky navigation helps older adults and younger users who aren’t as confident on the web.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Analyzed data from our websites - </strong>Data from people who visited more than two pages showed three common navigation behaviors:</li>
<ol>
<li>Clicking on the “What’s On This Page” box, which has anchor links to other sections of the page.</li>
<li>Clicking a link in the left navigation or the same section within the header.</li>
<li>Clicking a link to something else within the site, such as a header.</li>
</ol>
<li><strong>Created prototypes -</strong> We used a tool called InVision that let us quickly put together a low fidelity working prototype without having to implement any code. We built five versions of the prototype in desktop and mobile using mockups and integrated them into the tool that provided URLs for further user testing. You can see an example of one of the <a href=""https://gsa.invisionapp.com/share/9QF0ANQGJ#/screens/269821592"">InVision prototypes</a> we created.</li>
<li><strong>Conducted in-house research and user testing -</strong> Once we had the InVision prototypes working, we used them to answer three main questions from our own research:</li>
<ol>
<li>How effectively will sticky left and top navigation elements help our visitors navigate our websites?</li>
<li>Does sticky left navigation make it easier or more difficult to navigate within a topic?</li>
<li>Does sticky top navigation make it easier or more difficult to navigate from one top-level topic to another?</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We then conducted eight separate, unmoderated usability tests with nine participants. Each used the&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;prototypes and the static version of the navigation for comparison. We tested versions in desktop and&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;mobile resolutions.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Usability Test on Sticky Left Navigation: Desktop Findings</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Task success rates for both the static and sticky left navigations were excellent. The one participant who failed the sticky navigation test had a problem with the labels of some links in the left navigation, not the navigation itself.</li>
<li>Average time to first click was significantly faster with the sticky navigation (40 vs. 12 seconds).</li>
</ul>

<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Usability Test on Sticky Top Navigation - Mobile Findings</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Task success rates for both the static and sticky top navigation were excellent: 100% success for both designs.</li>
<li>The time to first click was slightly better on the sticky navigation design (14 seconds vs. 12 seconds on the English site and 11 seconds on the Spanish site).</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.&nbsp;<strong>Implementation -</strong> We analyzed the English and Spanish usability testing results and feedback and&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then discussed findings and recommendations with the product owner and with the development&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; team. They created and implemented the code on the websites.</p>
<p>We launched our sticky navigation elements a couple months ago and are keeping an eye on the data to see if we need to make any refinements. We’ve already seen users interact with them while performing other types of usability tests on our websites.</p>",https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/usa.govespanol%20sticky%20nav.png,,PUBLISHED,true

We get tons of questions from the public, and wanted to see if automation could help us answer them quicker. We also knew that scams are one of the top tasks for our website and contact center audiences. In late 2018, we blended our exploration of AI and expertise in scams to launch our chatbot.</span></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>But first, we researched. We wanted to hear from people who’d been affected by scams. We recruited people who had contacted us about scams, either through our contact center or Facebook. We spoke to 32 people, who shared their experiences with scams. They didn’t just tell the facts about reporting the scam. They also spoke about their emotions and motivating factors for reporting.</p>
<p>Our team held two workshops to make these conversations actionable. In the first session, we pulled noteworthy comments from those 32 conversations. We wrote them on sticky notes and then grouped them with other sticky notes that had similar themes. This session was critical for defining which problems USAGov would address. We learned that people were most concerned with three issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>knowing the right place to report a scam</li>
<li>identifying if something was a scam, and</li>
<li>figuring out how to recover money they had lost.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the second workshop, we sketched ideas to address the most common concerns. After two rounds of sketching, we voted on the ideas that seemed most useful and viable for USAGov to create. This session led us to believe that a personalized experience might lead to better outcomes for our users. And thus the idea of&nbsp;our chatbot was born.</p>
<p><img src=""https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/Screen%20Shot%202019-03-25%20at%202.25.52%20PM.png"" alt=""Example story board of how someone would interact with Sam with a scam/fraud-related issue"" width=""274"" style=""width: 274px;""></p>
<p>Before building, we created a flowchart to map out all the responses and navigation. This was key to directing users to an answer for their problem. Since we wanted Sam to be personable, we wrote friendly and empathetic messages. We learned that our marketing automation tool offers chatbot building capability. This expedited the time to launch, at no extra cost. In early February 2019, we launched the bot on three USA.gov webpages. In over a month we’ve had over 4,000 users, and 78% have successfully asked their question and gotten an answer.</p>
<p>We’re still getting started with AI, but we have big plans for the future. In&nbsp;later versions,&nbsp;our chatbot will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be bilingual</li>
<li>Tackle more topics from USA.gov and USAGov in español</li>
<li>Accept and respond to free text entries</li>
<li>Ask users about their satisfaction with the tool</li>
<li>Integrate with our contact center, to answer basic questions.</li>

<p><!--more-->At USAGov, we have a team of accessibility subject matter experts that makes sure the products, services and content we develop are as easy to use as possible for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Here, USAGov’s Senior Innovation Specialist David Stenger fields five questions:</p>
<p><strong>What’s one thing people may not know about accessible design?</strong></p>
<p><em><i>Just how easy it is to meet the&nbsp;</i><a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><i>WCAG 2.0 requirements</i></a><i>. Design for all people, not most. Take advantage of the content so that every possible user can enjoy, interact with, and access the information and data available on your website. Engaging in this practice will help develop a wider market.</i></em></p>
<p><strong>What are some of the most common 508 violations that you notice?</strong></p>
<p><em>The most common mistakes are missing alt text on images, no visible focus for people using a keyboard instead of a mouse, and keyboard traps. These are also the easiest to fix from the start. It's very important to have clean code. Semantic markup is the key to accessible websites.</em></p>
<p><strong>How can people learn about the basics of accessibility?</strong></p>
<p><em>People can learn from a number of places that offer training. I always tell people the best place to start is on </em><a href=""https://section508.gov/""><em>Section508.gov</em></a><em> and, if you’re a developer, learn semantic HTML5 markup.</em></p>
<p><strong>Is there any anecdote that has stayed with you, that illustrates the importance of accessible design?</strong></p>
<p><em>Almost everyone will be temporarily or permanently impaired at some point in life, and those who live into old age will experience increasing difficulties in functioning. </em><em><br></em><em><br></em><em>I hear my wife yell every month when she tries to pay our daughter’s rent or utilities online: “You need to design this website for them!” &nbsp;The website does not show focus so you can’t see where you are on the site, and that's just the start of it. The biggest issue is that you can’t just log in and select a button to pay the rent. They give you a cart type page that has you select what you want to do, but nowhere on the page does it have you select “I want to pay rent.” You have to click four pages down into the site to pay the rent on a page that's titled Living Essentials. Now tell me who would think that is where you pay your rent?</em><em><br></em><em><br></em><em>This just shows you that a poorly designed website is inaccessible to everyone, no matter if you have a disability or not.</em></p>
<p><strong>When people talk about making a digital product “accessible,” many think of screen readers for the blind or other visibility accommodations. What are some other disabilities that are important to design for?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Physical or motor disabilities</strong></em><em> - make large clickable actions, give form fields space, design for keyboard speech-only use, and design with mobile and touchscreen in mind.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Dyslexia</strong></em><em> - Use images and diagrams to support text, align text to the left and keep a consistent layout, consider producing materials in other formats (audio or video), keep content short, clear and simple, and let users change the contrast between background and text.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Autism spectrum</strong></em><em> - Use simple colors, write in plain language, use simple sentences and bullets, make buttons descriptive, and build simple and consistent layouts</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Stenger also leads the <a href=""https://accessibility.digital.gov/"">Accessibility Guild</a>, a working group that meets weekly to share knowledge, offer guidance — and field your questions!</p>",https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/Screen%20Shot%202019-02-11%20at%204.08.28%20PM.png,,PUBLISHED,true

Recently, we launched our </span><span><u><a href=""http://usa.gov/partnerships"">partnership toolkit</a></u></span><span> to demonstrate exactly what our team does, show which agencies we’ve teamed up with in the past, and initiate conversations with potential new partners.</span></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>But, once you visit the toolkit, you may be asking yourself some key questions: How does that partnership really begin? Who will I be talking to? How will I know what to expect?</p>
<p>Here are three steps and pieces of information to ease stress and put the focus on the real task at hand: getting great federal information out to the public.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong style=""background-color: transparent;"">Clear and Timely Communication in Action:&nbsp;</strong>Once you submit our <span style=""background-color: transparent;""><u><a href=""https://connect.usa.gov/digital-toolkit-get-started"">Get Started Form</a></u></span><span style=""background-color: transparent;""> or send an email to </span><span style=""background-color: transparent;""><u><a href=""mailto:usapartnerships@gsa.gov"">usapartnerships@gsa.gov</a></u></span><span style=""background-color: transparent;"">, we receive an email detailing what you’re looking for in a partnership and how to contact you. Then, a member of the outreach team will contact you to schedule a call to get more context. We’ll tailor the members of our team we assign to the partnership (and ask you to do the same!) based on the nature of the request — whether it’s a simple social media messaging request or a cross-agency, Q&amp;A panel-driven Facebook Live event. Our promise is to get back to you promptly, whether it’s to ask for more information, clarification, or set a meeting.</span></li>
<li><strong style=""background-color: transparent;"">Expertise Through Examples:&nbsp;</strong>Our long-standing role as the aggregator of government information means we have many examples that can help you define your scope, choose elements to include in your campaign, and develop a doable plan and execution strategy. In 2018 alone, we have hosted six Facebook Lives in English and Spanish and co-created dozens of email and social media campaigns on topics including health, passport, consumer protection!</li>
<li><strong style=""background-color: transparent;"">Creativity and Flexibility:&nbsp;</strong>‘Meeting people where they are’ is one of our guiding principles. Some partners come in with many ideas or want to include specific features in a campaign, while others just have a simple nugget of an idea. We are open to starting with the smallest or most broad idea to create a final product or campaign that works for our combined audience and internal team. We work around important observances, like Hispanic Heritage Month or National Consumer Protection Week, and both our own and the partner’s demanding schedules to ensure we’re effectively delivering information to the right audiences. This includes making sure our team has the right bandwidth to work with you while also providing expertise and best practices that enhances campaigns.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is just a taste of what goes into our partnerships. To learn more about who we are, who we work with, and what type of work — big or small — can be built and shared through our many channels, explore our partnership toolkit. Stay tuned for more tips, tricks, and updates on how to build a meaningful partnership with us!</p>",https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/Screen%20Shot%202018-11-05%20at%207.40.57%20AM-1.png,,PUBLISHED,false
USAGov Blog,How We Held a Successful All-Virtual Workshop,How We Held a Successful All-Virtual Workshop,en,/blog/2018/09/how-we-held-a-successful-all-virtual-workshop,dcward,Design and Development,"Tools used during a remote workshop: agenda and notes, data, taxonomy, CMS and customer feedback and survey.",2018-09-10 00:00:00,2018-10-11T13:48:39.003Z,"<p>We scheduled an online workshop to discuss how to improve and reorganize our <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/military-and-veterans"">Military and Veterans section</a>. We all were teleworking the day the event was planned, so it became a 100 percent virtual session – which ended up being remarkably successful! We wanted to share some of what we learned to be best practices.</p>
<!--more--><h3>How We Organized the Workshop</h3>
<p>The tools we used:</p>
<ul>
 <li>A video conferencing tool</li>
 <li>A whiteboard visualization tool, for laying out new navigation, etc.</li>
 <li>A document sharing tool that allowed us all to track the agenda and keep notes (Tip: We found it was easier to keep both in the same document)</li>
 <li>A slide creation tool, for presenting the data</li>
</ul>
<p>We made sure that everyone had access to all the tools and sent out the agenda a few days before the meeting. Everyone was asked to review the current section and the whiteboard visualization in advance of the workshop.</p>
<p>We broke the workshop into two parts. The first part was scheduled from 10-12 p.m. (including a 10 minute break) with six people. In this session, we reviewed our internal data:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Google Analytics - what content was most popular, and what underperformed</li>
 <li>Customer Satisfaction Survey</li>
 <li>Customer comments</li>
 <li>Current navigation for the Military and Veterans section</li>
</ul>
<p>The afternoon was a working session, from 1-3 p.m. with five people, to improve the navigation and content on the pages we reviewed that morning:</p>
<ul>
 <li>One person was in charge of moving items on the whiteboard</li>
 <li>One person was in charge of taking notes</li>
 <li>One person was the subject matter expert and answered any questions</li>
 <li>One person was in charge of referencing the website</li>
 <li>One person had our Content Management System (CMS) open to see if assets were related to more than page.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How We Ended the Meeting</h3>
<p>We looked at the digital whiteboard one last time and were able to easily create a list of next steps.</p>
<p>In comparison, this wrap-up process was confusing and time consuming for a previous in-person workshop using Post-it notes. We had duplicated Post-its; some had already fallen off the wall by the end of the meeting. There was lots of second-guessing: Did we say we were going to delete this piece of content or keep it? What category did we say this Post-it goes under? Using a digital board solved these problems because it was much easier to view and track.</p>
<h3>How We Know the Workshop was Successful</h3>
<p>It definitely was better that all of us were virtual. Participation was good; I think we all said we felt more comfortable speaking since we were at home in our own private, comfortable space.</p>
<p>We all felt we stayed more focused because there were less distractions, like side conversations. We also didn’t have to bother with finding a conference room, which in our open space offices can be a challenge. We accomplished everything on the agenda, had a concrete list of next steps, yet we were able to finish the meeting ahead of schedule.</p>
<h3>Things to Remember</h3>
<p><em>When virtual, try not to talk over each other.</em> Let the person speaking complete their sentences before replying. If you cut a person off, they may lose their train of thought.</p>
<p><em>It’s okay to have pauses during the meeting.</em> During these sessions when everyone is throwing out ideas, it’s okay for everyone to stop and process at points. Don’t feel like you have to fill the space with conversation.</p>
<p><em>Doing everything online may not work for everyone.</em> Some people and groups are better at brainstorming when the group is physically in one room.</p>",https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/Workshop-1.png,,PUBLISHED,false

<p>Over the past few years, several “ELPers” have rotated through USAGov, working on the content, outreach, user experience, and analytics teams. They’ve contributed to projects ranging from refining USAGov’s YouTube page, to analyzing user survey data, to developing the Partnership Toolkit. We asked some of them about their experiences on the USAGov rotation.</p>
<h3>What hard and soft skills were you able to develop during your USAGov rotation?</h3>
<p>“I was able to develop my analytical skills immensely as I was reviewing website search data, Google Analytics data and survey comments to provide thoughtful recommendations for content creation and organization.” — <strong>Amy DiReda</strong></p>
<p>“During my rotation, I was able to develop hard skills like writing in plain language, learning more about 508 compliance and Excel. I also developed important soft skills like interpersonal communications, leadership and teamwork.” — <strong>Kristen DiReda</strong></p>
<p>“Content writing, presentation skills, metrics analysis, new system use/development (Hubspot, Drupal, Google Analytics), email marketing tactics” — <strong>Claire Loxsom</strong></p>
<p>“Research, analysis, writing, relationship building” — <strong>Raashi Parihar</strong></p>
<h3>What was a highlight of your experience with USAGov? Did you have a favorite day of your rotation?</h3>
<p>“Analytics and Content people got together for a two-day workshop facilitated by 18F to create a service blueprint to detail the process of receiving, cleaning, analyzing, and responding to open-ended feedback from USAGov surveys. We learned a lot!” — <strong>Scott McAllister</strong></p>
<p>“The USAGov Open House was a great opportunity for me to jump out of my comfort zone and link together the different parts of USAGov to share out who we are and what we do to the rest of TTS. I helped coordinate the event from speakers and presentations to the virtual-friendly infrastructure for the day of.” — <strong>Claire</strong></p>
<h3>What were some unique features of your USAGov rotation?</h3>
<p>“This was the first time I got to participate in a UX workshop. This was also the first time I was able to implement machine learning for a real-world problem.” —<strong> Scott</strong></p>
<p>“USAGov was my very first rotation at GSA. It was the perfect place to start my federal career because you can see first-hand how your work impacts the public.” — <strong>Kristen</strong></p>
<p>“When I got to USAGov, I expected a much bigger team based on all of the components associated with the brand (websites, operations, social media channels, UX and brand design, etc). I was pleasantly surprised to jump right in as a member of the team to try new things and hold a big role where learning-by-doing was so emphasized.” — <strong>Claire</strong></p>

USAGov Blog,Five Tips I Quickly Learned Leading a Team,Five Tips I Quickly Learned Leading a Team,en,/blog/2018/08/five-tips-i-quickly-learned-leading-a-team,dcward,Marketing,"The word ""Collarboration"" surrounded by the words: support, trust, assist, share, exchange, inspiration, teamwork, success.",2018-08-15 13:54:00,2023-06-15T15:10:44.656Z,"<p>Here are some key things I've learned while leading the outreach team — from sprint lengths and editorial calendars, to meeting overload and how to learn to lead more effectively.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Testing Sprint Lengths to Find an Ideal Pace</h2>
<p>Our team manages projects based on a<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=""https://www.agilesherpas.com/kanban-for-agile-marketing/"" onmousedown=""_sendEvent('Outbound','www.agilesherpas.com','/kanban-for-agile-marketing/',0);"">Kanban methodology</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and we use<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=""https://trello.com/"" onmousedown=""_sendEvent('Outbound','www.trello.com','/',0);"">Trello</a><span>&nbsp;</span>to track tasks. We used to work in two-week sprints, which was the time period recommended by an<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/becoming-an-agile-content-team"">agile methodology we, as well as our content team, use</a>. However we realized we weren’t always accounting for scope creep, competing asks, or even planning our time realistically, so we moved to a three-week cycle with one ""rest week"" for operations, management work, and retrospectives. We’re hoping this will help us iterate, reflect, and make better data driven decisions.</p>
<h2>Editorial Calendars as Sanity Checks</h2>
<p>We allow for changes to our<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=""https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2018/01/content-calendar-beyond-basic/"" onmousedown=""_sendEvent('Outbound','www.contentmarketinginstitute.com','/2018/01/content-calendar-beyond-basic/',0);"">editorial calendar</a>, even if they're last minute. Anticipating projects or campaigns we might have coming up is a great way to stay organized and, while we are a flexible team, this also keeps us honest about the plans we have.</p>
<h2>Roadmaps and Strategy Docs as North Stars</h2>
<p>What editorial calendars don't do is tie in the why. For us, strategy plans fill that void by providing a direction for the team's overall goals and objectives. They’re a bit like our own Constitution in terms of defining what the team does, what the established priorities are, and where we’re heading in the coming months, and even years.</p>
<p>Our latest Roadmap is, in many ways, crowdsourced. Much of this strategy came from our team's offsite (where we conducted a<span>&nbsp;</span>SWOT analysis), our program team’s offsite, our organization’s strategic priorities, and lessons we’ve learned.</p>
<h2>Making Meetings Count</h2>
<p>We’ve reduced the number of meetings we have. While our small team of six gathers often to talk through a project, event, or campaign, we realized that some of our scheduled meetings were duplicative, and smaller meetings between two or three people often worked better.</p>
<p>Currently, we have planning meetings every three weeks, regroups on editorial calendar strategizing once a month, and we’re all aware we may need to quickly come together when something critical is happening. We’re also experimenting with<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil/2018/06/11/12-smart-techniques-to-make-meetings-more-productive/?sh=76bab8b83172"" onmousedown=""_sendEvent('Outbound','www.forbes.com','/sites/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil/2018/06/11/12-smart-techniques-to-make-meetings-more-productive/2/',0);"" rel=""noopener"">ways to make our meetings more focused, interesting, and productive</a>.</p>
<h2>Be Human, Organize Around People and Values</h2>
<p>No one should lead solely by trial and error, and making a concerted effort to be open to learning is essential. Reading about leadership best practices, taking trainings, and getting a coach proved to be the most valuable tools for me. I'm also looking forward to feedback from a 360 review I recently asked peers, my team, and supervisors to complete.</p>
<p>Finally, accountability is important for both leaders and teams, and I’m constantly working with my team to optimize our workflows and improve our products and services delivery.</p>",https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/Collaboration.jpg,,PUBLISHED,true

<!--more-->
<h2>Card Sort</h2>
<p>The team took the&nbsp;<a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/how-we-created-our-disability-section-pt-1"">keywords people used when searching for disability resources</a>&nbsp;and created an open card sort using&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort"">OptimalSort</a>&nbsp;software. Doing an open sort meant our test participants were able to sort randomly listed keywords into groups and create categories that made sense to them; a closed card sort would set predetermined categories. We tested 44 people, mostly federal employees.</p>
<p>Some quotes from our testers:</p>
<ul>
<li>""I couldn't make a sub-menu. I wanted to put ""Insurance"" under ""Services"" and then place both ""Health Insurance"" and ""Disability Insurance"" beneath ""Insurance"". Couldn't make a relevant match for ""Youth Employment.""</li>
<li>""'Disability insurance' doesn't seem to go with any other topic, since it looks like it is intended for people who are not yet disabled or who do not recognize they may have a disability.""</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: We got a good start on how to organize the section and could then prepare a Treejack test.</p>
<h2>Treejack Test</h2>
<p>To help verify the categories our users created in the card sort and determine the findability of the content, we then did a&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.optimalworkshop.com/treejack"">Treejack test</a>. Our test participants started the test on the&nbsp;main USAGov navigation page, which included the new Disability Services section. We tested 62 people, mostly federal employees again.</p>
<p>Some quotes from our testers:</p>
<ul>
<li>""It seemed like a few of these items could be found in multiple places in the hierarchy, and I wasn't always confident that the one I picked was exactly right.""</li>
<li>""For the first task, I would not think Alzheimers was a disability; I'd look under Health instead. Same goes for a couple additional items. Some of the menu groupings felt unintuitive.""</li>
<li>""I had no idea we offer any of these kinds of services and am not sure some of the naming made sense to me.""</li>
</ul>
<p>Result: We found out it was important for each piece of content to be under two or more different topics. For example,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.usa.gov/disability-jobs-education#item-35577"">Employment Assistance for People with Disabilities</a>&nbsp;should be under both the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.usa.gov/disability-services"">Disability Services</a>&nbsp;section and the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.usa.gov/jobs-and-unemployment"">Jobs and Unemployment</a>&nbsp;section.</p>
<h2>Adding the New Section to the Site</h2>
<p>Our designers had to find an icon and image for the navigation page. Once those were ready, they were added to our content management system.</p>
<p>The seven new pages were published first, but not added to the navigation. We added the code ""META NAME=""ROBOTS"" CONTENT=""NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW"". This allowed the UX and content teams to QA the pages before they were crawled by Google and other search engines. Once we were done, we removed the code.</p>
<p>We'll continue to monitor and make tweaks to this section as needed.</p>",https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/treejack-task-1.jpg,,PUBLISHED,false

It takes time and resources to produce the content, test the sections, and build the infrastructure. This blog post is the first in a series about that process.</p>

<h2>How We Identified&nbsp;the Information Gap</h2>
<p>Disability.gov, the inter-agency government site that had provided information about government resources and programs for individuals with disabilities for 14 years, sunset in December 2016. When the website went dark, USAGov Contact Center agents were challenged to find other sites with appropriate resources to respond to inquiries.</p>
<p>One year later, data showed that our agents were still struggling to find information to help the people who were calling in search of disability resources. Our content team began researching how to fill this information gap.</p>
<h2>How We Researched and What We Found</h2>
<p>The first step was completing a review to determine whether we should consolidate existing information or create new content. Here are the areas we reviewed, and what we found:</p>
<h3>Current Internet Offerings</h3>
<p>This included government and non-government sites. We needed to see what information about this topic already existed.</p>
<p>We started by reviewing what we already had on USA.gov. We found that most of the information about disability resources was distributed over various articles and, in most cases, a link to a disability site was accompanied by just one or two sentences or a short paragraph.</p>
<p>Except for sites on disability laws, the other federal government information we found was limited, piecemeal, and not always easy to find. Private sector sites were generally tied to a particular charitable organization.</p>
<h3>Comments from USA.gov and Contact Center Surveys</h3>
<p>Our review of survey comments from USA.gov and the contact center revealed that people primarily want to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many hours they can work per week without jeopardizing their Social Security disability checks.</li>
<li>How to find grants for augmenting their home or making home modifications.</li>
<li>How to get grants to modify their vehicles.</li>
<li>Whether someone can get paid to care for a disabled family member.</li>
</ul>
<p>After analyzing our findings, it was clear that the answer to our question about whether there was a need for a site with this information was a big yes. People were seeking information on disability services, employment, and financial assistance but were not sure where to find reliable government information on these topics.</p>
<h2>How We Developed the New Content</h2>
<p>Based on our findings, we decided to create a section that would include both new and existing USA.gov disability content. The section would include information on unaddressed areas such as adaptive vehicle grants and service animals and under-addressed areas such as how to apply for disability benefits.</p>
<p>The work for the new section was divided among writers and then turned over to our editor, who massaged each draft and made sure they all had the same voice.</p>
<p>We wanted to make sure our new content was easy to find, so we conducted a Google Trend analysis to determine what to name the section.&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.usa.gov/disability-services"" onmousedown=""_sendEvent('Outbound','www.usa.gov','/disability-services',0);"">We titled the section “Disability Services”</a>&nbsp;after finding that this phrase was used more commonly in searches than phrases like “disability resources”. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As the editor reviewed the new content, our UX Team started planning the best way to organize the information. That work will be the topic of the next blog post in this series.</p>",https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/Disability%20Services%20Section-1.png,,PUBLISHED,false

<!--more--><p>This is a metric that measures how much our audience uses our content, in relationship to the amount of&nbsp; content we are spending time and energy maintaining.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our hope was that the KPI would help guide our work choices in a handful of areas:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the number of pieces of content that we manage down.</li>
<li>Jettison low-performing content.</li>
<li>Update existing content so it performs better.</li>
<li>Avoid adding too much content without deleting an equal number of low performers.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the last quarter, the KPI trended upward. That means the amount of content we were creating was holding fairly steady, while usage of the content by both web visitors and our call center agents was increasing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s the sweet spot that we’re trying to hit every month. We want our content team producing and updating highly useful content, not spending time maintaining content that our audience doesn’t need or want.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some things the KPI helped us analyze in the last several months:</p>
<ul>
<li>A small content clean-up in December led us to delete several duplicative pieces of content, which meant the team had fewer articles to maintain.&nbsp;</li>
<li>We’ve been slowly adding new videos and infographics to our site, but have continued to steadily delete low-usage content. That means these new content additions aren’t negatively impacting our efficiency.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In March, both web visits and contact center use of our content soared, leading to the highest content efficiency KPI to date.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Visits to GobiernoUSA.gov are steadily increasing, which we think is because of the work we’ve done to make our Spanish-language content more usable and findable.&nbsp;</li>

As we all know, social media is continually evolving, and we try to adapt accordingly.</p>
<!--more--><p>Our team reviews the performance data for all of our social media platforms several times a year to determine where we’re getting the highest ROI and thus, where we should be spending our time and resources. We look at different metrics such as the number of clicks, shares, and the level of reach a post has.</p>
<p>Based on what we learned in our recent reviews, we’re shifting our efforts away from Snapchat in order to focus on Instagram.</p>
<h3>Why We’ll Focus More on Instagram</h3>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong> Instagram is the third fastest-growing social media platform in the U.S. and six in ten adults (ages 18 to 29) are active on the platform, according to a <a href=""http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2018/03/01105133/PI_2018.03.01_Social-Media_FINAL.pdf"">2018 Pew Research Center report</a>. One of our goals is to increase our engagement with this young demographic. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Traffic:</strong> Our Instagram account has been steadily growing followers since we launched in March 2017. Research shows that the platform is growing and we can see the increase in engagement on our channels every day.</p>
<p><strong>Platform structure:</strong> Our content doesn’t disappear on Instagram. While we try to share relevant and useful content each week, you can still scroll through our older posts at any time. This makes recordkeeping more straightforward and allows us to keep a public archive. On Snapchat, posts disappear after 24 hours. Overall, Instagram has proven to be easier for us to maintain and grow. Our profile is much more visible, which allows for more organic follower growth, and the platform is user friendly, something that’s really important for us as a brand and service.</p>
<h3>Why We’ll Focus Less on Snapchat</h3>
<p>Our Snapchat following steadily increased after we <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/why-we-launched-a-snapchat-account-and-how-well-measure-success"">launched in 2016</a>, but that growth has since plateaued. Our completion rates per story have also gone down 20 percent in 2018. We suspect the user experience changes to the platform combined with the surge in popularity and growth of Instagram are behind this development. We’re going to continue to evaluate our future with Snapchat as a tool over the next few months, while we focus more and more on Instagram.</p>
<h3>Instagram Strategy for 2018</h3>
<p>You’ll be seeing more of us on Instagram and we’ll be focusing more on producing content for all ages, in English and Spanish. Follow <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/usagov/"">@USAGov,</a> if you haven’t already to see us experiment with polling, stories, video content, and even live events.</p>

<p>By partnering, we plan to extend the reach of our HIV.gov content by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing best practices for using social media and digital technologies</li>
<li>Establishing baseline&nbsp;measures for outreach activities, including email marketing and social media outreach</li>
<li>Increasing message amplification across our shared communication channels</li>
<li>Generating “lessons learned” to share with our audiences</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe that working with USAGov will strengthen the activities of HIV organizations across the country by improving the way that we communicate with all our audiences. Ideally, our experience teaming up with&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.usa.gov/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">USA.gov</a>&nbsp;will serve as a&nbsp;<strong>model for how your organization</strong>&nbsp;can leverage relationships with other organization to improve communication about HIV. We will continue to share updates as we work together to address the HIV epidemic.</p>

You can go to USA.gov for information on a variety of topics including health, housing, laws, and legal issues. USAGov can also help you find information on federal, state, and local government agencies and elected officials and about how to partner with USAGov community-based organizations.</p>",https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/USAGov%20Blog/USAGOV-HIVGOV.jpg,,PUBLISHED,true
USAGov Blog,Researching to Better Understand Our Print Publication Audience,Researching to Better Understand Our Print Publication Audience,en,/blog/2018/05/researching-to-better-understand-our-print-publication-audience,dcward,Content,The USAGov Consumer Action Handbook.,2018-05-02 23:00:00,2023-06-13T21:32:33.220Z,"<p>The <em>Consumer Action Handbook</em><em> (Handbook) </em>and its Spanish counterpart,<span>the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><em>Guía del Consumidor</em><span><span>&nbsp;</span>(</span><em>Guía)</em><em>, </em>have been mainstays of USAGov since the 1990s. However, life as a consumer has changed drastically since these books began. To understand the changing consumer landscape, a cross-functional group from USAGov conducted a study of the scope of these publications. We wanted to answer several questions:</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
<li>Who is the audience?</li>
<li>Do the <em>Handbook</em> and<em>Guía</em>&nbsp;meet the needs of the audience?</li>
<li>Should we continue producing these books? What should the scope of the books be?</li>
<li>If we should stop, what types of printed publication should USAGov produce?</li>
</ul>
<p>To help us understand our audience, their information needs, the consumer landscape, and their preference for printed publications, we knew we needed to explore both internal and external hard data. We gathered and analyzed data about the number of <em>Handbooks</em> we printed and distributed, the results of marketing efforts, and printing costs. In addition, we surveyed research about the demand for printed and electronic publications, demographics, and changes in how people consume information.</p>
<p>The team also wanted to include the thoughts of the people that use these books or produce consumer content. To do that, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the comments included with orders of <em>Handbooks</em> and&nbsp;<em>Guías</em><em>;</em></li>
<li>Read transcripts from past focus groups to learn what features people liked or disliked</li>
<li>Met one-on-one with past customers (teachers, local consumer offices), and other government agencies that produce printed publications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Studying these insights from customers really allowed us to understand our audience and how they interact with the products. The comments in the interviews were especially powerful, as we didn’t just have words on paper, but also vocal inflections and body language to reiterate their thoughts.</p>
<p>Our multi-method research allowed us to marry theory, statistics, and personal experiences. For instance, we found several research articles asserting that people prefer print publications over electronic ones. That finding was amplified by our data showing that our customers ordered 10 hard copies for every one publication download, and then hearing people explain <em>why</em> they preferred the printed versions over a PDF.</p>
<p>Through our research we were able to develop a complete story and sound recommendations that mapped back to our original questions. In fact, we included audio and video clips in our presentation to senior management, to emphasize the impact of these publications on real people.</p>",https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/USAGov%20Blog/CAH_0.jpg,,PUBLISHED,true

We collaborated on messaging for our various platforms including targeted email and social media. We covered many important tax topics, from <a href=""https://connect.usa.gov/do-you-qualify-for-the-earned-income-tax-credit"">finding out if you qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit</a> to <a href=""https://connect.usa.gov/watch-out-for-a-new-twist-on-tax-scams"">avoiding refund scams</a>.</p>
<!--more--><h3>Why We Did It</h3>
<p>Every year, we get many calls and searches from people looking for answers to their tax questions. In the runup to this tax filing season, the content team revamped the <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/taxes"">tax section on USA.gov</a> and the <a href=""https://gobierno.usa.gov/impuestos"">Spanish tax section on GobiernoUSA.gov</a>. It was important to highlight this new and improved content to help our audience find the tax information and services they need for all stages of the process.</p>
<h3>Our Process from A to Z</h3>
<p>Each week, content and marketing team members met for a brainstorming session. We got the ball rolling before the meeting by submitting ideas for messages in a shared document. The theme of the campaign was “The A to Z of Taxes”—each letter represented an important part of the process (i.e. C for Credits, H for Help).</p>
<p>We didn’t go in alphabetical order for the messages (nor cover every letter); it was simply a guiding principle that helped shape our overall strategy. Not being tied to a linear path allowed us to remain flexible. For example, if one week there was a breaking development on the tax scams front, we would move messages on that topic up in the queue. We focused on continuity between the messages and covering various segments of our audience (e.g. seniors, military members and their families). At the end of our campaign, we tied together all of the important pieces into <a href=""https://connect.usa.gov/get-answers-to-common-tax-questions"">a final message consolidating all of the resources shared</a> during the last three months. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>The overall metrics for our tax campaign show that we reached a wide audience and delivered helpful and engaging content. With an average open rate of 41.13%, our tax emails surpassed the current average of 37.59% across our email marketing platform. These targeted email messages also had a strong 8.64% average click-through rate. Though this is only slightly higher than our current average of 8.54% for all Money and Shopping emails, we gained important insights on what content our audience finds most useful.</p>
<p>We also tested more targeted subgroups and subscriber lists within the category. For example, our audience is very interested in how to find unclaimed or undelivered tax refunds, but niche information, like tax tips for active military or veterans, did not resonate as much. These insights will help us build on our content strategy in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

USAGov Blog,How We Developed User-Friendly Content Templates,How We Developed User-Friendly Content Templates,en,/blog/2018/04/how-we-developed-user-friendly-content-templates,dcward,Content,"A screen shot of the USA.gov page featuring information about FAFSA benefits. It shows sections titled ""What help is available?"" and ""Am I eligible?"" ",2018-04-20 00:00:00,2023-06-15T15:06:59.629Z,"<p>Content on the USA.gov and GobiernoUSA.gov websites provides information on many different government benefits, services, and programs. We group the content into various taxonomy buckets to make it easier for people to find what they are looking for. But after listening to user feedback, we realized that content about different programs wasn’t always written in the same style and format, which made it hard for people to find what they were looking for across topics.</p>
<!--more--><p>To address this challenge, we decided to pilot standard templates for two of our most popular types of content: government benefits and scams and frauds.</p>
<h3>How We Developed the Templates</h3>
<p>In order to develop the templates, we spent a lot of time analyzing feedback from our customers. We specifically looked at survey responses from our website users and listened to phone calls from our call center. We wanted to understand what types of questions people were trying to find answers to most frequently, and learn the biggest obstacles to finding that information.</p>
<p>When it came to the subject of benefits, we realized people were asking three main questions:</p>
<ul>
 <li>What help is available?</li>
 <li>Am I eligible for a specific program?</li>
 <li>How do I apply for that specific program?</li>
</ul>
<p>For our scams and fraud information, we learned that people wanted to be able to quickly identify if they had been a victim of a scam and if so, how to report it.</p>
<p>Based on those findings, we restructured all the content in our benefits and scams sections to make the most looked-for information easier to find.</p>
<h3>Testing the Templates</h3>
<p>In our new benefits section, users can now easily jump from benefit to benefit and information is laid out in the exact same format. For example, if someone started on our <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/food-help"">food assistance page</a>, and then moved on to our page about <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/help-with-bills"">help paying certain bills</a>, they would find information in the new streamlined template with clear headings so they could quickly determine if they qualify for various programs.</p>
<p>We took a similar approach with our scams information. Now no matter whether someone is reading about <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/common-scams-frauds#item-213469"">IRS imposter scams</a>, <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/common-scams-frauds#item-37207"">telephones scams</a> or one of the many other types of scams, &nbsp;they will find:</p>
<ul>
 <li>A quick summary of the scam to help them determine if they’ve been impacted</li>
 <li>How and where to report the scam</li>
 <li>Some quick tips on how to avoid this type of scam in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>We plan to test the success of these templates by monitoring new comments coming in through our web surveys and listening to more phone calls from our call center. If we find that people are better able to find answers to their questions now, we’ll have some validation that these new templates are working.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/USAGov%20Blog/Content%20Template%20Blog%20Image_0.png,,PUBLISHED,true
USAGov Blog,Lessons Learned Building a Web Tool for Small Businesses,Lessons Learned Building a Web Tool for Small Businesses,en,/blog/2018/04/lessons-learned-building-a-web-tool-for-small-businesses,dcward,Design and Development,A screen grab of the Contracting Opportunity Finder web tool main page on USA.gov. ,2018-04-12 00:00:00,2023-06-15T15:09:36.672Z,"<p>The process of searching for and bidding on federal government contracts is complicated, and last year <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Aa8KuEA9av7f0P0eozTs1oTdt_fPJPCN/view?ts=5ac3ae69"">our research</a> revealed that it was an area the public needed help navigating.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The research specifically showed that first-time contractors had a very hard time finding open federal contract opportunities they were eligible for. So we decided to create a tool that could help them through the search process. Our goal was to build a tool that provided some of the information found on <a href=""https://www.fbo.gov/"">FedBizOpps.gov</a>, but was specifically built for beginners.</p>
<p>In the end, our team of 10 people - including designers, developers, accessibility specialists, a content specialist, and a data scientist - developed a beta version of a tool we named the Contracting Opportunity Finder.</p>
<p>Here are seven key lessons our project team learned while building the tool:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check-ins help &nbsp;to keep a remote team in sync</strong>: Lack of time in the same room together can interfere with a team project, but there are workarounds. For example, we used daily stand-ups to keep the team on pace toward the end of development. On launch day, we logged in to an all-day virtual project room (we used a Google Hangout) and worked in a Google doc to track issues.</li>
<li><strong>Reference user stories constantly</strong>: Creating user stories early on and referring back to them regularly can help guide and prioritize all types of project decisions - from what search filters to use to the terminology of the tool. Specifically, there was one part of the tool that we put a lot of work into, but along the way we lost sight of the user story that had inspired it. Instead, we focused on getting a certain functionality to “work,” even though we should have realized sooner that it wasn’t going to add value. &nbsp;In the end, we wished that we had removed that part rather than spend time on it.</li>
<li><strong>Build the tool with accessibility in mind from the beginning:</strong> Planning ongoing sessions between designers, developers and accessibility specialists helped bake accessibility and usability into the tool from the early stages.</li>
<li><strong>Determine early how new code or design will fit into the existing site overall</strong><strong>: </strong>Plan for how front end elements of the new tool (like buttons, forms, error messages, and wizards) may affect the existing site. This can help to avoid breaking things at integration and ensure the consistency of the user experience across the site — you don’t want your style sheet changes to cause problems on other pages.</li>
<li><strong>Create wireframes with the layout of the tool before going into coding: </strong>Establishing the layout and functionality as the first step into low fidelity wireframes, before design or code development is injected, helped us visualize how the tool would work. This also saved us time by allowing for iterations and improvements before code implementation. The wireframes also allowed us to perform early user testing, and gave developers the ability to begin preparing the structure of the code in parallel with the visual design phase.</li>
<li><strong>Start user testing early, with one final test: </strong>Conducting early usability testing with a low fidelity (non-clickable) prototype confirmed early decisions on the layout and functionality of the tool. Also, conducting a final usability test with a working (clickable/functional) prototype helped us make sure that the functionality of the tool worked as expected. Getting constant feedback from people outside of the core team helped ensure a good user experience.</li>
<li><strong>Designate specific parts of tasks to close gaps: </strong>Breaking down large tasks into smaller pieces and then designating specific pieces to each team member can help with efficiency and ensure that work doesn’t slip through cracks. We found this could help when regression testing on different devices and browsers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tool has been in beta for a while, and we’ve been collecting data on how visitors are using it. Soon, we’ll be conducting usability testing on the page. We’ll use our findings to help us add user stories to our backlog, and we look forward to updating and improving the Contracting Opportunity Finder over time.</p>",https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/USAGov%20Blog/Web%20tool%20blog%20image.png,,PUBLISHED,true

<!--more--><p>We then analyze these comments to figure out how we can improve.</p>
<p>Recently we took a look at survey comments left by customers who had been accessing our <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/housing"">housing section</a>. Here’s what we found and the changes we made as a result.</p>
<h3>What People Told Us</h3>
<p>We gathered all of the information from our surveys into big Google spreadsheets. For this project, we used over three years of data. However, six months - one year’s worth of data is all you need to pick up on patterns that will indicate ways you can improve your site.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Clean up and sort the data. Delete anything with personal information, curse words, paragraphs of long off-topic stories, or any other comments that aren’t meaningful or helpful, like “Thanks.” As we cleaned out the data, we tagged these comments as:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Positive - “Your website is user friendly, well thought through, and organized.”</li>
 <li>Negative - “I was looking for X and I couldn’t find it.”</li>
 <li>Action needed - “I clicked on the link and nothing happened.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Look for common themes. When you go through the data, you’ll see recurring topics / situations / keywords. What we found:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Am I eligible for public housing?</li>
 <li>How/Where do I apply?</li>
 <li>Can I see a list of public housing with rent available in my area?</li>
</ul>
<p>This information was then put together in a report that was presented and handed over to the Content Team.</p>
<h3>How We Tried To Make Things Better</h3>
<p>Using these findings, we came up with some actionable next steps for both our English and Spanish language sites.</p>
<ol>
 <li>We <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/housing"">reorganized our taxonomy</a> in this section so that information about finding affordable rental housing was grouped together and information for those looking to buy a home was grouped together. Before, these two topics had been intermingled.</li>
 <li>We standardized the way we wrote the information based on the main questions people wanted answers to. Now all of our information on specific government housing programs have the same headings: <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/finding-home#item-37237"">What help is available, Am I eligible, and How do I apply</a>?</li>
 <li>Whenever possible we tried to clearly define the order of steps people need to take and provide customers with contact information for the program, in case they had specific question we couldn’t answer. This was sometimes challenging in Spanish and occasionally we have to direct our Spanish-speaking audience to English-language resources.</li>

We provide a multi-channel shared service platform to serve those who have questions ranging from housing assistance to how to file taxes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Each month, our team offers what we named Call Center Listening Sessions. These sessions are part of USAGov’s broader program efforts to constantly improve how we interact with our ultimate customers: the public.</p>
<h3>What is a Call Center Listening Session?</h3>
<p>The call center listening sessions, which are offered in English and Spanish, let our staff hear from our nationwide audience in real-time. We dial into the USAGov listening telephone line, where we can hear information specialists take live calls from the public. We usually host three 30-minute sessions each month.</p>
<p>Each session also offers writers, designers, UX experts and other collaborators on our staff the opportunity to talk about what they’re hearing.</p>
<h3>Why We Host Listening Sessions</h3>
<p>Our sessions provide staff the opportunity to learn more about the public’s struggles, challenges and victories with government information and programs. Leveraging the <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/contact"">Contact Center</a> makes us better equipped to understand a variety of user stories and improve the overall customer experience. The sessions assist with content improvements on the website and quality assurance evaluations that help us meet and surpass our service level targets. Each listening session:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improves customer experience through direct insight into the voice of the customer</li>
<li>Promotes discussion within teams</li>
<li>Provides insight into our contact center operations</li>
<li>Facilitates program-level changes based on customer needs</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the addition of Spanish-language sessions, the USAGov team has also been able to pick up on subtle differences in communication styles, and how culture plays a role.</p>
<p>Our “call-in” listeners note that they love these sessions and that the experience provides them an opportunity to stay connected to customers, promotes awareness about contact center operations and allows them to make changes based on customer needs. We look forward to continuing to provide the best possible service to everyone.</p>

USAGov Blog,Using 2017 Email Success to Springboard into 2018,Using 2017 Email Success to Springboard into 2018,en,/blog/2018/03/using-2017-email-success-to-springboard-into-2018,dcward,Marketing,A line chart showing that USAGov email open rates rose to peak at 32.5 percent in 2017.,2018-03-15 00:00:00,2023-06-15T15:10:07.429Z,"<p>Email is an easy, time-saving way for us to connect the public with government information and services. We strive to provide clear information about relevant topics to our more than 850,000 subscribers, in hopes that our emails will stand out in inboxes overflowing with news alerts and sales offers.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We set a target of a 15 percent open rate and a 1.5 percent click rate for all of our emails in both English and Spanish, based on past performance and industry benchmarks. In 2017, we developed new tactics and fine-tuned our approach. As a result, we surpassed our engagement goals and ended the year with a 18.6 percent open rate and a 1.65 percent click rate. Multiple emails doubled our initial goals.</p>
<p>Here is what we did that worked, lessons learned, and how we will continue to optimize the way we communicate with our subscribers through email.</p>
<h3>What We Tried:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Delegating to an Email Team: Instead of having one person managing our email campaigns, with some content support, last year we designated a team of content and marketing specialists. This allowed us to share the responsibility of brainstorming, scheduling, drafting, and organizing emails on a weekly basis.</li>
<li>Targeted Messaging: Throughout the year, we sorted and created email lists based on the topics subscribers in specific locations were requesting information about, in order to send relevant information to targeted groups. This was particularly beneficial during the hurricane season when we were able to send recovery messaging to people in Texas post-Hurricane Harvey while simultaneously sending preparation resources to people in Florida and Puerto Rico. This meant people only received information that applied to them, and resulted in engagement rates that were steady or above expectations.</li>
<li>Thoughtful Day and Time: Through analysis of our past sends, we were able to see what emails and, more specifically, what topics performed well at different times. For example, we’ve found that Mondays and Fridays are optimal days for sending email, and clicks and opens peak on those days in late afternoon. Some emails, such as job postings, perform well no matter when they’re sent. This gave us the opportunity to be more strategic about the ‘what’ and ‘when’ with ease.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What To Expect in 2018:</h3>
<ul>
<li>More List Creation: We've been analyzing email performance data over the past few months and we're beginning to think more strategically about who wants to receive what type of message. We’ll be experimenting with creating lists based on past email engagement and segmenting based on location, subtopic, and activity, as well as working to develop surveys to learn more about our audience.</li>
<li>Links and Call-to-Actions (CTA): Our emails either direct subscribers to new resources an agency releases, or consistently promote the same important, in-demand information while changing the language in the call-to-action (CTA) button of the email. We’re testing the language, length, and resources our CTA buttons link to in our emails, and potentially standardizing a few links around each of our main topic areas that tend to perform well and provide the best information.</li>
<li>Length and Type of Content: With the increase in mobile views and the need for more digestible information, we’re experimenting with shorter paragraphs, more bullets, and more infographics in emails to see how our subscribers need to use what we send out.</li>
<li>Efficient Topic Tracking: As you may expect from a platform providing broad cross-agency information, we have topics that consistently perform better than others. We also have subjects that need more frequent updates, which make us gravitate towards promoting more of that information. With the help of an organized team and automated records showing what emails we send on each topic each week, we can work to address military and health as often as we address other subjects like money and shopping.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re bumping up our goals in 2018 and working to understand what information is most important to the hundreds of thousands of people who rely on these messages. We’ll share what new tactics are helping us surpass our new 25 percent open and 2 percent click rate quarterly goals!</p>

One of the main ways we do that is by researching to zero in on the keywords people are using when they search for a topic. Then we incorporate those keywords into our page titles and content summaries.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Last fall, we worked on a project to come up with a label that describes the group of benefits that includes food stamps, low-income housing and other related government services. Our main goal was to add a category, titled with this new label, on the USA.gov pages that lists important resources in each state. We refer to these as our state directory records. Our challenge was to find a common naming convention for those benefits so people would recognize it, regardless of where they live.</p>
<h3>Five Steps for Finding a Link Name</h3>
<p>1. Research Gathering - We created a spreadsheet listing all 50 states, territories and the District of Columbia. Under each, we listed the name of the agency that handles food stamps and other government benefits. We were surprised by the variations in names:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arizona - Department of Economic Security</li>
<li>Georgia - Department of Human Services</li>
<li>Guam - Department of Public Health and Social Services</li>
<li>South Carolina - Department of Social Services</li>
<li>Texas - Department of Health and Human Services</li>
<li>Washington - Department of Social and Health Services</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Google Trend Analysis - Next, we conducted Google Trend searches that compared words using three- and 12-month time frames in order to look for seasonal changes and year-over-year patterns. Words we used included social services, human services, food stamps, welfare, TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families), SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and other benefit terms. The word “welfare” was the top term used.</p>
<p>3. Anecdotal Evidence - We looked at a presentation done by a local nonprofit agency that offers charity benefits on how the term “welfare” is perceived. The word is not used in current material for distribution, so we eliminated it from our list.</p>
<p>4. Report Analysis - Our final report shows how we narrowed our options to “human services” or “social services.” &nbsp;We then forwarded these findings to our user experience (UX) team for one last round of testing.</p>
<p>5. Unofficial Poll - The UX team created an anonymous poll to help us get a sense of which term the average person might use. While the results weren’t scientific, they helped validate some of our other findings.</p>
<h3>What We Decided</h3>
<p>Based on our research, we decided to use the term “social services” to label the category that references this set of benefits available at the state and local level. We’ll be adding this new category to our current state directory records pages in the coming weeks.</p>

Here are overall trends from the first quarter (Q1) of FY18.</p>
<!--more-->
<h3><strong>Web Metrics</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Overall Traffic</strong></p>
<p>October and November 2017 could not compete with the presidential election highs of the same time last year. However, traffic in December 2017 was 19% higher on <a href=""http://usa.gov"">USA.gov</a> and 3% higher on <a href=""http://gobierno.usa.gov/"">Gobierno.USA.gov</a> as compared to December 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Popular Topics or Directory Records Included</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>USA.gov: voting and elections, green cards, and directory records for the U.S. Postal Service and the Department of Defense</li>
<li>Gobierno.USA.gov: green cards, unemployment benefits, enlisting in the armed services, food assistance, and directory records for the State Department and Department of Labor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mobile Use</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>USA.gov: 39% (6% increase over 2-year span)</li>
<li>Gobierno.USA.gov: 39% (18% increase over 2-year span)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Traffic Sources</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>USA.gov: 71% of traffic came from search. In FY18Q1, USA.gov pages showed up in Google search results 732 million times with an average click-through rate (CTR) of 3.7%.</li>
<li>Gobierno.USA.gov: 48% of traffic was categorized as Direct and 41% was from search. In FY18Q1, Gobierno.USA.gov pages showed up in Google search results 7 million times with an average CTR of 6%.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Decommissioning of Publications.USA.gov</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://publications.usa.gov"">Publications.USA.gov</a> was decommissioned on December 20, 2017. The site had about 36,000 visits in FY18Q1.</p>
<h3><strong>Contact Center</strong></h3>
<p>While Contact Center touchpoints were down in multiple areas during FY18Q1, the addition of Login.gov as a customer agency contributed to an overall touchpoint increase of 4% as compared to FY17Q1.</p>
<p>The following increases/decreases are based on comparisons between FY17Q1 and FY18Q1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calls: increased 3%</li>
<li>Chats: decreased 18%</li>
<li>Emails: decreased 11%</li>
<li>Postal mail: decreased 40%</li>
<li>Interactive Voice Response (IVR) self-service: increased 15%</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Customer Satisfaction</strong></h3>
<p>USAGov uses the Government Customer Experience Index (GCXi), which is based on a scale of -100 to 100.</p>
<p><strong>USA.gov</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>USA.gov had a very small drop in satisfaction (67) and task accomplishment (37) in FY18Q1 versus the previous quarter. Passports and Contact Elected Officials aren't dominating the survey like they used to, which is contributing to the decrease.</li>
<li>Immigration and Post Office Issues dropped for the second quarter in a row.</li>
<li>Complaints and Scams were down.</li>
<li>Looking for a Job was up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GobiernoUSA.gov</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Last quarter, Gobierno set a record for satisfaction. This quarter, satisfaction is still very high (84), but task accomplishment is the lowest that it's been awhile (32).</li>
<li>Quarter to quarter drops occurred on the Home Page, Entering the U.S., and Foreign Trade.</li>
<li>Consumer Protection was up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Phone had its third down quarter in a row (75 satisfaction, 64 task accomplishment).</p>
<p>Chat dropped in Q1 after a half year of improvement (51 satisfaction, 38 task accomplishment).</p>
<p>Email went up for the second quarter in a row (36 satisfaction, 24 task accomplishment).</p>
<p>For the sake of accountability and transparency, we hope to share these summaries each quarter in FY2018.</p>",https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/USAGov%20Blog/DeviceUseFY18Q1.jpg,,PUBLISHED,false
USAGov Blog,Facebook Live: How We Do It and What We Learned in Year One,Facebook Live: How We Do It and What We Learned in Year One,en,/blog/2018/02/facebook-live-how-we-do-it-and-what-we-learned-in-year-one,dcward,Marketing,Facebook Live: How We Do It and What We Learned in Year One,2018-02-22 00:00:00,2023-06-15T15:10:26.681Z,"<p>Almost a year ago, we started broadcasting live on Facebook. In that time, we learned a lot about what works and what doesn’t. As a result, we hosted Facebook Live events that were better scripted, tackled more complex topics, and most importantly, were more engaging to our audience.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We decided to try Facebook Live because it presented an opportunity to learn and interact with our audience in real time. It was a way to put a human face on a web platform and fulfill our agency’s goal to serve the public.</p>
<p>We also wanted to see if live events helped us earn favor with Facebook’s ever-changing algorithm. As the platform shifted to focus on friends and family, and publishers got fewer views, Live gave us a chance to notify our audience when we’re producing original content.</p>
<h3>Planning a Facebook Live</h3>
<p>The combination of live video with real-time question answering has been successful for us, but going live requires planning and preparation.</p>
<p>The first thing we needed was the right hardware. This meant getting a camera and laptop setup that worked for our needs. We also needed to prepare a studio space within our office. That included testing the lighting, colors and acoustics in the room. USAGov tends to follow a talk show set format, but settling on that took several practices and testing a few options.</p>
<p>It’s also really important to make sure your “on-air talent” understands the material and feels comfortable in front of the camera. Your behind-the-scenes team needs to understand the technology and be able to smoothly handle the flow of questions that will come in from your audience. Our team ran some mock Facebook Lives to help perfect our approach both in front of the camera and behind the scenes and make sure everyone was familiar with what they would need to do during the event.</p>
<p>Our main lesson from the first few events is that we could continuously adapt and improve our graphics, studio setup, hardware needs, and more.</p>
<p>More than any on-screen or production improvement, the power of a good partnership became clear. By bringing in a partner agency, we introduced new subject matter experts to our audience and gave our partners a new format to share their message. Some of our most successful partnerships so far include talking about passports with the State Department, benefits with the Social Security Agency and scams with the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<p>The success of each live event usually depends on a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The topic or partner: government services that are extremely popular tend to perform better as a large part of the population wants to learn more about them.</li>
<li>Timing: knowing who your audience is and when they are online is key. For example, if you’re looking to reach school teachers, a weekday before 5 PM is probably not the best time.</li>
<li>Competition: try not to compete with a big TV show, national news event, or a major sporting occasions. No matter how good or important your content is, you might struggle to get enough attention if you’re up against a big event.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Year Two: More Partners, More Platforms, More Adaptation</h3>
<p>An important aspect we want to focus on for the new year is to partner with informed experts on these types of events. We launched our <a href=""https://connect.usa.gov/digital-toolkit-get-started?hsCtaTracking=3bb49b7f-cd56-41b0-97b6-635499c7849d%7C70165247-7c2e-4c55-a877-90a61243f1a6"">Partnership Toolkit</a> in late 2017 to explore more collaboration opportunities with other parts of the government and even NGOs.</p>
<p>Another piece of our brand we want to expand in 2018 is to explore live broadcasting on other platforms like Twitter and YouTube. In the next few months, we’ll being exploring those options. We’ll use our Facebook Live expertise to adapt to the changes and needs of the different audiences.</p>

People on the island turned to radio and social media as a lifeline. Family members on the mainland searched for information they could easily share via text.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To communicate vital, life-saving information, we worked with social media influencers to amplify the messages of subject matter experts from FEMA and the National Weather Service. This helped ensure that critical information reached the people who needed it most.</p>
<p>We identified influencers as people who were subject matter experts, celebrities, and others, as well as regular people who have become famous online with a powerfully engaged audience.</p>
<p>Most social media experts recommend approaching influencers slowly. However, due to the severity of the storm, we quickly approached influencers to help us get vital information out immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why did we target influencers during hurricane season?</h3>
<p>Influencers helped us:</p>
<ol>
<li>Expand our reach when communication was difficult. Through influencers on the ground, such as local artists, we learned about <a href=""https://twitter.com/GobiernoUSA/status/911649146305748997"">the main questions</a> and the most urgent needs in the affected areas. It also gave us the opportunity to address misinformation and rumors with the public directly. This type of real-time outreach on a day-to-day basis lasted for weeks and evolved as the disaster went from preparedness to response to recovery.</li>
<li>Reach new audiences. Interacting with influencers allowed us to connect with people who weren't following us at the time, such as those followers of a local singer in Puerto Rico. Since influencers have a personal attachment to certain geographical areas or communities, our replies to their messages gave us an insight into the needs of specific regions.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h3>How did we find the right influencers?</h3>
<p>Following the conversation on location-centered hashtags, like #MariaPR, allowed us to follow area-specific developments. Tracking these hashtags also gave us insight into new influencers we didn’t know and who were active. The team treated those hashtags like a timeline so we could keep in touch with what was happening on the ground, even 90 days after the storm had passed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How did we develop a relationship with influencers?</h3>
<p>Rather than developing a relationship over time, we quickly provided influencers with <a href=""https://twitter.com/GobiernoUSA/status/912414207932600321"">the information they were looking for</a>. We listened, watched, and read their messages and determined how we could help them. This separated us from other accounts simply looking for a retweet or mention. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite this unorthodox approach, we developed a trusting relationship with influencers simply by listening and providing official government information in a timely manner. The power of our brand and the fact that we were providing answers in real time let influencers know we were reliable. Moving forward, we hope to continue to build relationships with influencers, so we can work with them to share important government information to audiences that we might not be able to reach on our own.</p>

Based on this premise, we set out to find out how agencies could share information with one another to improve the customer experience.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To narrow the scope of our research, we decided to focus on one specific task that touched multiple agencies. So we set out to understand and map the path of a newly naturalized citizen attempting to travel abroad.</p>
<p>The path a person would need to take to accomplish that task would have them interacting with U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services (USCIS), the Department of State (DoS), Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) and Transportation Safety Administration (TSA).</p>
<p>We brought together representatives from those agencies to participate in a journey mapping exercise led by Matt Ford, GSA’s Deputy Chief Customer Officer, to uncover intersections between agency service offerings.</p>
<h3><strong>How We Prepared</strong></h3>
<p>We met with Matt to discuss what we knew about travelers in this journey from the conversations we had with agencies. We wanted to understand the process of obtaining these services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Naturalization (USCIS)</li>
<li>Passport (DoS)</li>
<li>Trusted Travel Programs (TSA or CBP)</li>
</ul>
<p>Before the exercise, we asked each agency to think about the steps, timeline, touchpoints, systems and documents/data needed for a customer to accomplish their task.</p>
<p>In addition, we offered a placeholder/high level value chain diagram that showed the potential for improving customer experience by cross agency coordination in five areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Streamline processes</li>
<li>Reduce cost (agency)</li>
<li>Reduce cost (customer)</li>
<li>Increase adoption of services</li>
<li>Increase citizen satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Exercise Steps</p>
<ol>
<li>Agencies worked within their teams to think about each step their customers had to take to obtain the desired service (research, application, photos, fees, etc.). They wrote each step on their assigned colored stickers, discussed among themselves and then placed them on the board.</li>
<li>Teams were mixed so one agency member could relate the customer journey to the rest of the agencies. Team members listened and reacted to their colleague’s comments and added their comments and possible intersections to the board as they saw opportunities.</li>
<li>One person per agency stood by the board and explained the steps their customers would take to get their service to the entire team. The team took the role of the customer, listened and wrote their emotions and the opportunities they saw on sticky notes and placed them on the board.</li>
<li>The last part of the exercise was Emerging Opportunities (the moments of truth or AHA moments). The participants identified some processes agencies had in common as well as things that could be improved, blockers and opportunities to make changes (policy, authorities, etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 18px;"">What We Found</strong></p>
<p>Not surprisingly most of the feelings recorded in step three were negative. People felt intimidated, overwhelmed, stuck, confused, over burdened, anxiously waiting, uncertain, etc.</p>
<p>But we identified some potential opportunities in step four:</p>
<ul>
<li>Streamline customer information requirements across agencies &nbsp;</li>

But whether you call it outreach or communications or marketing, government often has a need to get key information to the public.</p>
<!--more--><p>Today, government communicators have more channels than ever to try to reach their audiences. On the digital side, there are websites, social media, email newsletters, and blog posts. And there are of course non-digital avenues like public service advertisements, print publications, media relations and direct mailings.</p>
<p>At USAGov, we’re lucky to have a very small team of people who are experts at navigating this overwhelming communications landscape. They dedicate their time to making sure government information is shared in an easy-to-understand way on the channels where it makes the most sense.</p>
<p>However, we’ve heard from other project teams in our office that they need help with this too. They lack a dedicated communications person, and often don’t know where to begin with a marketing or engagement effort.</p>
<p>That’s why we’re launching the Marketing Lab. The lab is a pilot program where members of our team will spend a handful of hours each week volunteering with other project teams in our office.</p>
<p>The lab will offer support in three main areas of service:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Strategy - developing a communications strategy, identifying target audiences and appropriate distribution channels</li>
 <li>Messaging - refining key messages and calls-to-action</li>
 <li>Editing - polishing content already written in English or Spanish (for email marketing, social media, press releases, blog posts, landing pages, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>The lab will also host office hours where anyone from within the organization can stop by to ask a quick question or talk through a communications challenge with a lab volunteer.</p>
<p>Our Marketing Lab concept is based on the successful <a href=""https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/01/22/18f-writing-lab/"">18F Writing Lab</a>, and we hope that in time we’ll be able to share some of the Marketing Lab successes and our lessons learned.</p>",https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/USAGov%20Blog/ThinkstockPhotos-631930982.jpg,,PUBLISHED,true
USAGov Blog,Five Communication Tactics We Used During the 2017 Hurricane Season,Five Communication Tactics We Used During the 2017 Hurricane Season,en,/blog/2018/01/five-communication-tactics-we-used-during-the-2017-hurricane-season,dcward,Marketing,Five Communication Tactics We Used During the 2017 Hurricane Season,2018-01-11 01:00:00,2018-10-11T14:48:45.049Z,"<p>In 2017, it was nearly impossible to turn on the news or go on social media without hearing stories about hurricanes across Texas, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.</p>
<!--more--><p>Because the timing of these storms overlapped, new information was constantly coming out about seeking shelter, volunteer opportunities, and other response and recovery efforts.</p>
<p>When disasters of this magnitude occur, the Department of Homeland Security designates USA.gov and GobiernoUSA.gov as the official communication channels for the cross-agency federal government response effort. We had a challenging, but important role to play in helping people across the country prepare for and recover from multiple hurricanes.</p>
<p>To do this, we used different tactics across our channels to ensure we were delivering accurate, helpful information to those who needed it most. The major communication challenges brought by these disasters, such as power outages, limited battery life, and phone reception forced us to think outside the box and develop new strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Targeted Email Messaging:</strong> Using our email marketing tool, we were able to sort email lists by geography and send alert information before, during and after storms to affected people in Florida, Puerto Rico and Texas. For example, we sent recovery messages, such as damage assistance applications and volunteer opportunities, to people in Texas, while simultaneously sending preparation information to people in Florida. This targeted messaging meant people got only the information that applied to them at the time they needed it.</li>
<li><strong>Short, Visual Posts:</strong> To be conscious of limited connectivity, the fast pace of the storms, and to avoid overwhelming followers with information, we stuck to a model of clear infographics or images, short text, and singular links on social media. Being quick and direct in sharing recovery aid information, Red Cross efforts, and other <a href=""https://twitter.com/USAgov/status/909552551066050560"">messages</a> meant users could find the help they needed without surfing the web.</li>
<li><strong>Meeting People Where They Were:</strong> By following hashtags, such as #MariaPR and #Harvey on social media, we found the right audience for each message, tracked questions related to the storms, and provided official government information in a matter of minutes. This helped us recognize what topics hurricane survivors frequently asked about, allowing us to provide timely information such as scam defense and how to avoid overwhelming volunteer organizations.</li>
<li><strong>Distinguishing Location on USA.gov:</strong> With back-to-back hurricanes, it was important to differentiate between information and assistance for those in the continental U.S. and on the impacted islands. We organized information on USA.gov and GobiernoUSA.gov pages labeled by the storm name and by location. In the case of Hurricane Maria, the content tailored for audiences located in the continental U.S. focused on how to locate family members, make donations, and avoid scams. The content for audiences in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands focused on shelters, assistance for victims, and safety information. We aggregated the most relevant information from federal and local agencies and used social media and local news outlets to keep a pulse on what information different audiences needed most.</li>
<li><strong>Influencer Outreach:</strong> We collaborated with local reporters, media outlets and radio stations, addressing rumors and questions directly on social media, and referencing subject matter experts like the Red Cross and FEMA in messaging. Stay tuned for more information on this approach in an upcoming blog post!</li>
</ul>
<p>With these strategies, we reached more than two million people throughout one of the most devastating hurricane seasons in U.S. history. <a href=""http://usa.gov/explore"">USAGov</a> provided preparation and recovery information to those in need through social media, email, radio, and even traditional media. We’ll continue to provide government information to those affected by natural disasters as long as it’s needed. We’ll always be with the public through these disasters and anytime they need us in the future.</p>

<!--more--><p>Our new approach will help us meet our audience where they are, increasing the direct and personalized assistance that our audience needs, while reducing the number of generic posts we share from the account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Here’s what we’re trying</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Talk to Us </strong></h4>
<p>Whether you are an individual seeking an answer about a government program or service, a fellow agency that wishes to partner with us, or a member of the media looking for information for your audience, just chat with us. Tag @GobiernoUSA in a post on Twitter to ask us a question directly. We constantly monitor our social media presence and we’ll find an answer for you. If we can’t answer you right away, we’ll help you find someone who can.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>We’re Bilingual</strong></h4>
<p>Our data shows that our Hispanic audience is tech savvy and consumes content online both in English and Spanish. This is especially true of the younger generations. Our team has members of different age groups and backgrounds, and we know how vital bilingualism is in everyday life. Starting now, we’ll be communicating in both English and Spanish from the GobiernoUSA Twitter account. Ask us in whichever language you are most comfortable in, and we’ll answer back in that same language.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Active over Reactive</strong></h4>
<p>In many cases, our audience doesn’t know we can help them through the issues they currently face. As part of our new strategy, we will be more active listeners -- monitoring trending topics so that we can give you the help you need. If you’re tweeting questions about renewing a passport or facing consumer issues, we’ll help to resolve your question. If you’re a social influencer with a niche audience like travel, education, or retirement and need information about a certain program, we’ll guide you to the right resource.</p>
<p>You can monitor this blog because we’ll be sharing updates along the way about what we learn from these experiments.</p>

However, most agencies only learn they can easily work with us by word-of-mouth.</p>
<!--more--><p>Because of this, we realized we were missing opportunities to work with you and your agency &nbsp;on different types of outreach and engagement efforts. So we created a new, easy process for initiating conversations, clearly communicating how we can support your efforts, sharing case studies, and assessing the impact of our partnerships.</p>
<p>Our new <a href=""http://www.usa.gov/partnerships"">Partnership Toolkit</a>&nbsp;makes it easier for you to start working with us right away. This online toolkit explains the range of outreach services we offer and helps us initiate a partnership with more context on both sides of the engagement.</p>
<h3><strong>Here’s how it works:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>First, review the Levels of Partnership.</strong>&nbsp;We laid out four different levels of partnership to show both short- and long-term opportunities and what they might look like. A partnership can be as simple as a retweet about a new product or campaign or a full-blown effort including message amplification, a live Q&amp;A session and other types of outreach tactics. Review these options so you have an idea what might work best for you.</p>
<p><strong>Then learn the skills our team can bring to our partnership.</strong>&nbsp;We are composed of email marketers, social media experts, data analysts, and bilingual consultants, who will work with you to find new ways to engage audiences.</p>
<p><strong>All you need to do then is submit the “Get Started” form.</strong>&nbsp;You’ll provide some details about the project, note any specific skills you need and establish a point of contact to kick off discussions.</p>
<p><strong>If you need any extra convincing before contacting us, you can also check out the testimonials from other agencies we’ve worked with in the past.</strong> Not only do we showcase summaries of different types of agency engagements (a Spanish-language live event with SBA, a six-month scam awareness campaign with FTC) but we also give a snapshot of the experience our existing agency partners have had working with the us.</p>
<p>Our goal is to make it easier for you to connect with our team’s expertise and capitalize on the reach of the USAGov brand. By working together, we can inform and engage the public through meaningful campaigns to guide audiences to key government information and services.</p>

To help us with that, our analytics team developed a new metric we’re experimenting with called the content efficiency metric.</p>
<!--more--><p>This metric is a key performance indicator (KPI) that we’re hoping can help guide our content decisions. Content is our most “expensive” product to produce and maintain. It feeds our websites and our contact center’s knowledge base, and we want to make sure we’re being as efficient as possible in how we manage it.</p>
<p>The metric takes into account the outcomes of our work in terms of (1) unique pageviews on USA.gov and GobiernoUSA.gov and (2) how many times a piece of content was used to help answer a contact center query.</p>
<p>It also takes into account the amount of work done to get those outcomes by dividing the amount of use our content got by the amount of content we were maintaining at that time. &nbsp;That’s why it’s called an “efficiency metric.” &nbsp;It’s the ratio of the outcome of our work on our original content &nbsp;versus the amount of work it took to make the content.</p>
<p>The hope is that the KPI can guide work choices. In general:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Keep the number of pieces of content that we manage down.</li>
 <li>Jettison low performing content.</li>
 <li>Update existing content to do better.</li>
 <li>Avoid adding too much content without deleting an equal number of low performers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is to maintain a knowledge base of content people really want to use and make sure they can find it. We’re hoping this metric will help us make sound decisions to get us there. We’re in the early stages of using it, and we’ll share updates as we go. &nbsp;</p>

Last year, we initiated an effort to explore methods of getting feedback from the public about their experiences accessing key government services.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We researched options and identified a third-party stakeholder research software tool to test. The tool transforms hundreds of public comments into a short list of usable recommendations. In December 2016 we launched a pilot study with the tool, in partnership with the U.S. Department of State (State).</p>
<p>State estimates that more than 20 million Americans will apply for or renew a passport this year, which would make 2017 the busiest year for The Passport Office in history. Passport Services staff were eager to make the processes as easy as possible and committed to doing so. &nbsp;Therefore, they were interested in getting feedback about the popular service. State’s passport processes were thus an ideal match for the software. By the end of the pilot study, the partnership would lead to a set of key recommendations that helped motivate changes to the passport process.</p>
<h3>How we got started</h3>
<p>The software tool we used works by providing users with a customizable website, which we used to post questions and receive public comments. The site also allowed for two-way communication, similar to social media, so we were able to update the people who made suggestions as we completed each step of the pilot.</p>
<p>We narrowed our focus to request public feedback on a single area of the passport process and asked:</p>
<p><em>“The U.S. Department of State wants to improve your experience of applying for or renewing a passport. How can we improve the application process to make it simpler and easier?”</em></p>
<p>USAGov then posted a link to the site requesting feedback on multiple platforms including our own websites. We also shared the link with our Twitter followers, Facebook fans, and email subscribers. The U.S. Postal Service and the White House also pitched in by inviting participation through their websites.</p>
<h3>How it worked</h3>
<p>Over two weeks in December nearly 1,000 people responded to our request. Each time a participant responded, the tool also asked them to highlight the portions of their comments they considered to be the most important. Then they were asked to refine those highlighted comments by placing them into a list of categories, based on the growing body of participant feedback.</p>
<p>System administrators later fine-tuned those categories into a list of recommendations for State that was, for all intents and purposes, authored by the public.</p>
<h3>How it went</h3>
<p>The recommendations were welcomed by Passport Services, which was fully invested in improving its processes. While some of the concepts had already been suggested or were in the early stages of implementation, new ideas included sending renewal reminders to customers and expanding services to allow the public to get passport questions answered on evenings and weekends.</p>
<p>In response to the recommendations from the public, State decided to make several significant changes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beginning research on expanding customer support to 24 hours a day, 7 days a week</li>
<li>Coordinating with other federal agencies to streamline passport paperwork</li>
<li>Beginning research on a future passport renewal notification system</li>
</ul>
<p>State analyzed the recommendations, assessed its current action plan, considered how to incorporate changes, and determined how to act on the information. In any large organization, gaining buy-in to implement decisions can be challenging. However, having the distilled opinions of a large sample of the population helped overcome that obstacle, and made the buy-in process easier at State.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>We hoped operating in a more agile manner would help us address some of the challenges we were facing as a team:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being asked to support many new projects</li>
<li>Competing priorities</li>
<li>Bottlenecks and silos</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a big change in the way we work. Our previous model had been based on a newsroom-style operation where people were clustered together around specific areas of content or “beats” to use the journalism terminology. The newsroom model works really well for media outlets with bigger teams of people, but for a small government content team, it wasn’t the best fit because it didn’t easily allow people to support projects or user needs not on their “beat.”</p>
<p>Operating in a more agile manner lets us shift resources to whatever user need is most pressing at the moment. If it’s tax season and we need to make major updates to our tax content, we can now more easily pull anyone from the team to support that effort. We’re able to balance resources to match priorities and work in a more proactive, rather than reactive, manner.</p>
<p>We’re not following any specific agile methodology by the book, but the way we operate now more closely resembles Scrum than Kanban. We spend time grooming our backlog of requests, we hold bi-weekly sprint planning meetings and retrospectives and we use a board to track our work in progress.</p>
<p>We don’t hold official daily stand-ups, but we regularly communicate about the status of work and roadblocks to keep things moving.</p>
<p>While our process isn’t perfect, and we’re certainly still learning as we go, operating in a more agile manner has helped us focus our priorities and deliver content that will help our users accomplish their tasks.</p>

While transferring ownership of a Twitter account is fairly easy to do from a technical standpoint, transferring email ownership and tools is not.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We had to tackle several things at the start of this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build new pages where people could sign up to get emails.</li>
<li>Configure backend logic and rules.</li>
<li>Transfer massive lists of email subscribers from one email management tool to another.</li>
<li>Communicate major changes to the current subscribers who would be impacted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we had those logistical challenges tackled, new challenges emerged.</p>
<p>There were approximately 460,000 email addresses in the BUSA email list that received a weekly email newsletter. A list that large is hard to manage and serve well. So we dug deeper and examined the analytics to determine how we could best serve this audience.</p>
<p>We asked:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many of these folks were regularly engaging with BUSA content?</li>
<li>How many people were opening messages?</li>
<li>How many people were clicking on content in the newsletters?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our answer was clear, though disappointing. Only a fairly small percentage of subscribers were active.</p>
<p>Since most email tools, including our own, charge based on the size of subscriber lists, we needed to strategically determine how we could remove subscribers uninterested in BUSA content, while keeping those who were active. So we launched a re-engagement campaign. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We asked subscribers who had not opened an email in more than six months to click on a subscription link to avoid being removed from our list. We sent two emails with a very clear call to action — stay or go. It read ""Are You Still Interested In Receiving Our Emails?"".</p>
<p>About two percent ultimately decided to stay with us. &nbsp;After a few weeks, we significantly reduced our subscriber numbers by removing the uninterested subscribers, resulting in substantial cost-savings.</p>
<h3>Results and Next Steps</h3>
<p>Our open rates have skyrocketed since we implemented our subscriber re-engagement campaign. They’ve gone from about 6-7% to 35-40%. The industry average for government email is 26.33% according to the experts at <a href=""https://mailchimp.com/resources/research/email-marketing-benchmarks/"">MailChimp</a>. We now serve people who enjoy receiving our emails and have a better gauge on which topics related to business development are valued by our subscribers. But we're far from done updating our email communications strategy. We are working on implementing plans to improve our click rates and promote greater engagement.</p>
<p>We’ve identified our next challenge to tackle: Why are people opening our emails but not clicking on much of our content? We’re exploring possible causes of that and asking ourselves questions like: Are we including too many topics in a single email? Are our templates too busy and not drawing the reader’s interest?</p>
<p>We refine our approach to increase engagement as we develop our new email marketing strategy, test ideas, and deliver content from <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/business"">USA.gov/business</a>. Stay tuned!</p>",https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/532040/Email%20Graphic.jpg,,PUBLISHED,true

<!--more--><p>In September, we officially unveiled the USAGov parent brand. And then last month, we launched a <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/explore/"">new online exploratory landing page</a>. We'd like to devote a little time here to talking about this branding change — from the background and research that went into the decision, to where we hope to go from here.</p>
<p>For starters: What name did USAGov replace?</p>
<p>For the last 15 of our almost 50 years, our program was called the Federal Citizen Information Center. But many people knew us more by our various channels — USA.gov, GobiernoUSA.gov, Kids.gov, or Publications.USA.gov — or by our contact center number, 1-800-FED-INFO. And that was one of our biggest issues. We’ve grown and evolved, adapting constantly to meet changing customer needs and adopting new technology. But a byproduct of that growth was a collection of outreach channels that didn’t always seem to be related to each other or tie back to our FCIC name.</p>
<p>So early last year, as we planned to relaunch USA.gov and GobiernoUSA.gov and changed our contact center number to 1-844-USA-GOV1, the time was right to explore rebranding the whole program.</p>
<p>Those efforts began with two key steps:</p>
<ul>
 <li>In February, we conducted a focus group with English speakers, Spanish speakers, and bilingual participants to help gauge the public’s awareness of USA.gov and GobiernoUSA.gov, as well as the resources those sites offer.</li>
 <li>Then in April we conducted an online survey to assess the public’s awareness and understanding of USA.gov.</li>
</ul>
<p>This research spotlighted several areas that we felt needed addressing:</p>
<ul>
 <li>When asked to name the URL for the official website of the U.S. government, just 4% of survey respondents replied “USA.gov.” Another 9% answered with a fictional “US.gov” site.</li>
 <li>When survey respondents were asked to choose the “official government website” from a list of URLs, 66% either didn’t know or chose the wrong URL. Just 33% picked USA.gov.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was clear: Recognition and the public’s understanding of USA.gov were both too low. We needed to unify our many channels under one overarching brand that could grow, and that people would recognize and trust for government information and services. USAGov will do just that.</p>
<p>Next post: We’ll talk about why.</p>

The new structure, content, and look and feel are based on data from top searches and analytics, top questions to the call center, and user behavior learned during usability testing.</p>
<!--more--><p>The three main goals of this latest release were to:</p>
<ol>
 <li>simplify the content and highlight top tasks front and center;</li>
 <li>enhance the site’s performance by getting rid of clutter and merging duplicative content; and</li>
 <li>make it easy for users to start their search with fewer clicks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, these home pages now feature a “What’s New” section with the latest content, which is also syndicated through our social media channels or agency partners.</p>
<p>We will monitor and continue to gather data and user feedback for future iterations of the home page, and we'll share more on how we designed and developed the new home pages in an upcoming post.</p>

<!--more--><h3>Methodology and Results</h3>
<p>Data informed every step we took. In order to determine which areas to focus on first, the desk gathered data from four distinct sources: the Contact Center's usage of our content to answer customers' inquiries; site analytics; content inventory and review; and website survey comments. A report and an action plan were produced which would serve as the main driver of our content overhaul.</p>
<h3>Steps We Took and Lessons Learned</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Approach. </strong>The team decided that all the subtopics were going to be part of the audit, and took a bottom-up analytical approach during the discovery phase. This type of approach occurs when the analysis of the metrics is done without a defined goal. Although we technically had a goal -- improve our content-- it proved to be too high level. We struggled with the approach because we were trying to find answers when we didn’t know yet the questions to ask. <em>Lesson learned: Select a representative sample of the content, observe the metrics over time, and clearly define the focus before beginning the work.</em></li>
<li><strong>Timeframe for Analysis. </strong>Time constraints forced us to focus on our objectives and prioritize data that we determined would be most insightful. We arrived at our customer's page level comments as a good starting point. <em>Lesson learned: Most things take longer than expected, so more time should be allowed for the discovery portion of a content audit.</em></li>
<li><strong>Survey Comments Analysis. </strong>What users were telling us in the survey comments was the key to setting our goals. We systemized the analysis in a way that we could determine what would eventually become our content goals: determine what users were trying to do in our pages, how they were trying to do it, and change the negative sentiment of some of our pages with better content. The result of the systematization informed the usability, information architecture tests, and the content analysis heuristics. <em>Lesson learned: Challenge everyone’s assumptions about the content and users’ interaction with it, and turn survey comments into quantitative data. It helps to easily identify trends and opens up a conversation on user versus ""creator.""</em></li>
<li><strong>Content Analysis. </strong>As part of the discovery phase, there was a content analysis heuristics where we compared existing content with the survey comments and the analytics data, and we made a list of potential content to test, improve, move, or delete. The content analysis heuristics took the form of regular face-to-face meetings of the desk members with a UX team member. We considered issues with the quality of our content, such as usefulness and relevance, clarity and accuracy, completeness, style; with the information architecture such as usability and findability, completeness, consistency, and appropriate structure of our assets. <em>Lesson learned: We don’t know our web content until we audit it, and all team members are figuring it out together. </em></li>
<li><strong>Testing. </strong>We know that optimization is an ongoing, iterative process, and that next time our content is ready for another audit our objectives and planning will be different. <em>Lesson learned: There is no such a thing as a standard content audit process. Data (or external circumstances) will set the stage for the next steps. It is imperative to lay out a framework and context for what you're auditing, why, and what your main objectives are. The goal is always the same--improve the public's experience with your content.</em></li>

It’s how we try to help keep the rest of the office in the know. The monthly newsletter can spur a content idea, a future marketing endeavor, and act as a reminder of what's coming up that month that contributors need to be aware of. It also gives a heads up to our Analytics Team about what promotions could be the causes of increased website visits, email, and social media traffic.</p>

<p>In addition to sharing upcoming campaigns, we also highlight the top three best performing email and social media messages across our accounts. It's a great way to showcase the work being done, but also denote what topics and messages are really resonating with our audiences.</p>
<p>Partnerships are at the heart of what we do. Therefore, we also share information about which agencies we're partnering with and supporting, since much of our mission is centered around supporting other government agencies' efforts.</p>
<p>Last but not least, including an ""In Case You Missed It"" section is also a great way to keep readers engaged, and make sure that if they happened to miss a Marketing Minute bulletin, they can still be up to date on what efforts have taken place.</p>

We cover a lot of topics in Spanish via our website, social media platforms, email sends, and contact center. One of the communication channels we focus a lot of attention to is social media; and we routinely measure how our efforts are going.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We focused first on our assumed engagement power hitter - Facebook, to learn more from its Insights analytics data. By last May, we had reached 26,138 likers and we have steadily grown since February of this year. We've done this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementing a systematic approach to the publishing of messages</li>
<li>Scheduling during the time of the day where our audience is mostly online</li>
<li>Increasing the amount of published posts per day</li>
<li>Crafting messaging based on ""call to actions"" and a more engaging tone</li>
</ul>
<p>We publish content on various topics, and also wanted to identify which topics resonated most with our audience. Though we believed that we had a good mix of topics, the data told us a different and surprising story. We knew that Facebook's erratic algorithm could possibly be responsible for some of the reach our posts were getting, but we knew that this couldn't be the only argument for lower engagement on some posts.</p>
<p>By doing these four things consistently, we were able to almost double the number of our post engagements, and increased significantly the volume of impressions. We knew that investing in Facebook would have big returns, and the data delivered on that effort.</p>
<h3>Checking Our Assumptions with Data - Facebook</h3>
<p>We created a workflow interface so we could easily sort our social media content calendar with Facebook Insights. We soon discovered that we were sending a great number of messages related to health and consumer money topics, but less on immigration, labor training, education for adults, ESL resources (English as a Second Language), and employment, topics that showed high engagement results.</p>
<h3>Checking Our Assumptions with Data - Twitter</h3>
<p>Analyzing our Twitter data proved to be a much bigger challenge. We learned that our followers are fickle, while one day some topics resonate well, other days, not so much. We used our same workflow spreadsheet to sort through our tweets, and quickly learned that our money and education topics had the greatest number of impressions, while immigration and voting topics had the most retweets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good news with Twitter is that you can send a few more messages in a day without overwhelming your followers, so while we plan to focus more on the topics that resonate most with our audience, we will continue to publish a big mix of topics. Partnering with other agencies and retweeting their content will help us continue to provide a variety of content while offering relevant information for our followers.</p>
<h3>Topics We Will Focus More Heavily On</h3>
<p>For Facebook, job training, career opportunities, immigration services, and learning English will be the topics we'll most heavily focus on. We also will continue to reach out to our agency partners letting them know that these topics resonate well with our audience. This is how many successful Q&amp;A's and Twitter chats have taken place over the years. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For Twitter, we will continue to partner with other agencies on Twitter chats that resonate best for our audience, and while we've partnered many times on topics related to health, we're looking to further engage our audience by doing more active listening on the topics that resonate with them most.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>Last year, the USA.gov team found themselves facing a challenge. We were in need of a new content management system for our websites, <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/"" style=""text-decoration: underline;"">USA.gov</a> and <a href=""https://gobierno.usa.gov/"" style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Gobierno.USA.gov</a>, which help people find and understand the most frequently requested government information. We wanted to align the content on those websites with content in the knowledge base used by our contact center; up until this point, the information in those two places had been similar but unique. In addition, we thought this was an opportunity for a design refresh.</p>
<p>That’s a whole lot of “new.” &nbsp;Where to begin?</p>
<p>We decided to start with the data! &nbsp;A lot of that data was from the Digital Analytics Program’s (DAP) Google Analytics (GA) account -- mainly, how were people using our current versions of the site?</p>
<p>Some of us set out to create a new knowledge base that would fill our future version of the site and our contact center’s customer resource management tool with wonderful content. We looked at usage of the existing content in our contact center and on the web in order to isolate the most needed content. For web content, we used GA, in particular, <a href=""https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1257084?hl=en"" style=""text-decoration: underline;"">unique pageviews</a> for an entire year. Some of our content is seasonal, so it helps to look at a year at once. Using unique pageviews helped us line up a little bit better with our data sources like content used by our contact center agents.</p>
<p>The GA data helped us know what was most popular in obvious ways, and therefore what to keep and what not to keep. However, it also influenced our understanding of our users’ needs in a way that influenced our design. <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/"">USA.gov</a>and <a href=""https://gobierno.usa.gov/"">GobiernoUSA.gov</a> have a handful of standout popular content, but even the standout content really just adds up to a small portion of the overall site usage. That helped us understand that we wouldn’t be focusing prominently on any dominant tasks.</p>
<p>To better understand user behavior, we wanted to know how people got to our sites, where people started their visits, what they did when they got there, and how long they stayed. Google Analytics was helpful on all counts. Most users came from search engines, and they primarily did not land on our home page. &nbsp;Rather, they started their experience with us on a content page somewhere within our site, and for them, that was in effect our home page. This influenced our design by telling us that users would be orienting themselves on pages that we normally wouldn’t consider as a place to come to understand what our website is about. This was one of our data sources that convinced us to really pare down the design to just the essentials: one primary place for content, navigation, and search.</p>
<p>GA told us that our visitors did not hang out with us for very long. After jumping into the middle of our site from a search engine, they most often read the content on that one page and then used one of our links to pursue what they were trying to do. This was despite having a design that had columns of little boxes about other things that people might be interested in; so GA was one of the data sources that convinced us to strip that out. &nbsp;For those visitors that did stay with us for more than one page, there was a big drop off after two or three pages. That led us towards a controversial decision: the parent pages that would feature links to the section “beneath” them would not share the navigation choices on the left side that the content pages would have. We simply lacked the data to point to that supported people wanting to navigate up and up, step-by-step. Now that we have time, we are actually implementing a new navigation on parent pages, and we’ll be interested to see the impact.</p>
<p>Google Analytics also helped us understand that mobile users were becoming an increasing percentage of our customers. This contributed to our desire to make sure that our design was equally direct for users on mobile and desktop, and therefore to allow our writers not to think about different platforms when writing. The result was one column of content on every type of device. If an idea wasn’t important enough to be included in the main content, then it didn’t need to be in a desktop-only bonus box on the side.</p>
<p>Overall, Google Analytics usage data helped us pare down a sprawling site with busy content pages in a more efficient site that catered to its true primary users: people jumping in from Google to get an overview of a topic and know where to go next, and perhaps check out very closely related information as well. It’s also been hugely influential on our home page designs, as we strive to create a home page that enables the types of uses for our site that are most prevalent. But that’s a blog post for another day!</p>

The decision was difficult, but necessary to focus more resources online.</p>
<!--more--><p>Under USAGov, the publication program had a successful run of more than 45 years. President Nixon established it in 1970 to help federal agencies share consumer information with the public.</p>
<p>A year later, we began publishing the <strong>Consumer Information Catalog</strong> to promote and distribute agencies’ consumer publications. We needed a dedicated distribution facility to store and send out those publications. And Pueblo’s Congressman Frank E. Evans was instrumental in creating legislation to place the distribution facility within his city and bring us on as its customer. At one time, one in four Americans surveyed knew the name ""Pueblo"" was related to government publications, thanks to our public service announcements on TV and radio.</p>
<p>From helping folks buy refrigerators to picking an investment adviser, the USAGov program, known over the years as the Consumer Information Center and the Federal Citizen Information Center, has been the U.S. government’s face for trusted consumer Information. Local and national news outlets, especially the weekly magazine, <strong>Parade</strong>, regularly mentioned our publications, and columnist Dear Abby promoted packets of publications on timely topics with great response from her 110 million readers.</p>
<p>Through the years, we distributed 1.27 billion publications and <strong>Catalogs</strong> at a low cost to the more than 200 federal agencies and programs that participated, and mostly free to our customers.

<!--more--><p>At USAGov we cover a lot of topics and partner with many agencies. Having an editorial calendar has helped us in a variety of ways, from staying on top of deadlines and deliverables, to giving us the space to focus on the topics that resonate best with our audiences.</p>
<h3>How We Populate Our Calendar</h3>
<p>The USAGov team has a lot of ideas and many partners to work with. Across our group we have content managers who follow specific topics and build partnerships among specific initiatives and contact center points of contacts who routinely share frequently asked questions. Anyone can submit a campaign idea through our Google Form, which asks the following:</p>
<ol>
 <li> <p>What is your idea?</p> </li>
 <li> <p>When will this promotion take place?</p> </li>
 <li> <p>Who is the target audience?</p> </li>
 <li> <p>What language is this promotion in? English? Spanish? Both?</p> </li>
 <li> <p>What website(s) will this promotion impact?</p> </li>
 <li> <p>What support will be needed?</p>
  <ol>
   <li> <p>Social media</p> </li>
   <li> <p>Email</p> </li>
   <li> <p>Syndication wire</p> </li>
   <li> <p>Media outreach</p> </li>
   <li> <p>Partner outreach</p> </li>
   <li> <p>Graphics/multimedia support</p> </li>
   <li> <p>Technical support</p> </li>
   <li> <p>Metrics support</p> </li>
   <li> <p>Other</p> </li>
  </ol> </li>
 <li> <p>Who is submitting this idea?</p> </li>
 <li> <p>Any other info we should know about this idea? (Helpful links, commitments to agencies, etc)</p> </li>
</ol>
<h3>How Ideas Turn Into Campaigns</h3>
<p>These ideas populate a spreadsheet which the marketing team routinely looks at and discusses. We try not to have more than two or three large campaigns a month, though we do leave room for emerging topics or requests from partners or other stakeholders.</p>
<p>Editorial calendars are a great way to keep the team focused and organized. They also serve as great reminders of activities taking place, and keep everyone apprised of projects each month. Our editorial calendar also helps connect national observances and natural ties to other agencies' content dissemination efforts.</p>
<h3>How We Manage a Swelling Calendar</h3>
<p>Editorial calendars can have as little or as much detail as you think you need. But generally, it is much more manageable to include fewer details and to avoid having information that's out of date, especially in fast-paced environment where aspects of campaigns are being tweaked or have many moving pieces. &nbsp;This is more aimed at a bird's eye view of what's coming, and what we've done. It isn't designed to be a project workflow. While our editorial calendar updates are a bit of a manual process, we've realized that sometimes keeping things simple really is better. Anyone can update it, and anyone can include comments, questions, and other details.</p>

It’s a concise and simple site with a single mission: direct citizens through the voter registration process as quickly as possible. It was created by a joint team of <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/"">USA.gov</a> staffers and <a href=""https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/"">Presidential Innovation Fellows</a>, all of whom work within the <a href=""https://www.gsa.gov/"">General Services Administration</a>.</p>
<!--more--><p>Did it work? Yes. In fact, it worked so well that Facebook made it the destination for their 2016 voter registration drive. Last Friday, it received over five million user visits, among the highest count ever recorded by a U.S. government website in a single day.</p>
<p>It was a good site, but there was room for improvement. The site was only available in English. The pages for individual states did not have URLs, so it was hard to share them with other people. We weren’t sure if the front page really needed to be that long.</p>
<p>So, earlier this year, USA.gov worked together with <a href=""https://18f.gsa.gov/"">18F</a> to research, prototype, test, and implement an improved version of vote.gov.</p>
<p>Today, on National Voter Registration Day, we’re launching this new version.</p>
<p>The changes are small, but significant:</p>
<ul>
<li>The whole site is now <a href=""https://vote.gov/es/"">available in Spanish</a>.</li>
<li>Thanks to usability testing and analytics, we realized we could remove much of the front page content. The site entrance is now considerably leaner and faster: the total data that a user has to download is less than one-third of the previous amount.</li>
<li>The visual design has been updated, and is now based on another USAGov &amp; 18F collaboration: the <a href=""https://standards.usa.gov/"">US Web Design Standards</a>.</li>
<li>The site is fully functional without Javascript.</li>
<li>All parts of the site are reachable via URLs, which allows people to share individual state pages directly in &nbsp;either English or Spanish.</li>
</ul>
<p>The largest change will be totally invisible to most users: we’ve switched from a bespoke single HTML page to a multi-page site deployed on 18F’s <a href=""https://cloud.gov/"">cloud.gov</a> application platform. This gives our development process more flexibility, and made the above improvements much easier to implement. If this is the aspect that most interests you, feel free to take a look at the <a href=""https://github.com/18F/vote-gov/"">source code</a>. As always with our open source projects: code contributions are welcome!</p>
<p>Finally, please share the site. Voting is a great privilege of citizenship. We want everyone who can to register to vote.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>While content marketing can take many forms (articles, infographics, videos, and more), it shares a common purpose: providing useful content to attract new customers to your product or service. At USAGov,&nbsp;customized email messages to our subscribers represent one of our most powerful content marketing tools.</p>
<h3>What’s the Core Concept?</h3>
<p>Every USAGov email begins with an idea either from our content or marketing team. In essence, messages we provide highlight timely information on an important topic—money, health, voting, travel, and more.</p>
<p>Below are some of our most popular messages. What do they have in common? Clear calls to action and descriptive text about what you can expect when you open that communication.</p>

<h3>Why So Much Emphasis on Email?</h3>
<p>Our objective is to connect more people to the government information and services they need, while providing interesting and relevant information that keeps our audience growing. We identify trending topics and tie them back to government resources. Finding those angles is key.</p>
<p>Email marketing, whether to promote our brand, or content, or both, serves as a highly effective outreach channel.&nbsp;For the last several months, email has been, on average, the single highest source of non-search engine referrals to USA.gov. That means it has brought more people to our website than any single social media channel or website.</p>
<p>But, what makes someone open and click on an email?</p>
<p>When we reflect on an email's performance and review the data, it helps us put the pieces together. This forces us to check our assumptions on what we think is relevant versus what people are actually interested in. In the world of checking email more times than any other platform, we have to make sure that we're grabbing the reader's attention and engaging them from the start. That means a clear subject line as a starting point. We also time messages when we think they'll most likely be opened, make sure that they're mobile optimized, and keep them interesting. We put ourselves in the shoes of our readers to ensure that what we're sending reflects what people are eager to receive.</p>
<h3>Key Factors for Success</h3>
<p>Most importantly, a successful message requires collaboration and open communication between our content and marketing teams. This two-way street facilitates ideas and improvements along the way. Oftentimes, both have a good feel for a trending topic, but the content team serves as the subject matter expert. The marketing team edits and shapes the message ensuring that it captures the essence of the subject. This forms a symbiotic relationship between teams that drives successful email content marketing.</p>

Using technology to erase bureaucratic boundaries, BusinessUSA streamlined the way businesses find and get what they need from government. &nbsp;This “no wrong door” approach combined resources from over 800 websites and created a single point of entry for businesses looking to grow and expand. &nbsp;</p>
<!--more--><p>At <a href=""http://usa.gov/explore"">USAGov</a>, we’ve been fans and supporters of BusinessUSA since the beginning. And although we serve different audiences, our two programs have shared the same fundamental vision - that government should use technology to make it easier for people to find the federal resources they need.</p>
<p>We’re now thrilled to announce that USAGov will be integrating the two websites in order to provide a single, comprehensive collection of tools and resources—delivered in one central website. In the coming months, we’ll be working to build the best of Business.USA.gov into the USAGov platform. &nbsp;Once complete, this cutting-edge platform will better serve the American public and the nation’s businesses.</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing more details with you this summer. As we work through this exciting merger, the BusinessUSA email newsletter will take a short summer break while we integrate the email systems. &nbsp;In the meantime, you can stay in the loop with business news on the <a href=""https://twitter.com/BizUSA/"">BusinessUSA Twitter</a> account, and get updates on the website integration project and all things USAGov by <a href=""http://connect.usa.gov/blog-email-sign-up-page"">signing up to our blog</a>. &nbsp;</p>

Tim Lowden, learned early on that “life can’t be scripted and that nothing’s ever going to follow the exact path you set.”</p>
<!--more--><p>Originally hired to work for Challenge.gov, Tim transitioned to DAP after just a year with GSA. By his own admission, he didn’t know what an API was when he started working for the federal government, but the DigitalGov community offered the opportunity to gain hands on technical knowledge. Since then, Tim has been a part of a major cultural shift with regard to data sharing practices. Where there was previously a culture of sensitivity around data that didn’t necessarily need to be protected, DAP and <a href=""https://analytics.usa.gov/"">Analytics.USA.gov</a> have cultivated an environment that encourages transparency.</p>
<p>When asked what he liked most about his role, Tim responded, “our tool is serving government well, it saves the government money while equipping agency users with information that can be used to benefit the public,” but this wasn’t always the case. Tim’s tenure at GSA has been one big cycle of change, many occurring within DAP itself. In fact, DAP has evolved through three distinct phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Agency users received access to their data only</li>
<li>All DAP agency users received access to the entirety of DAP’s data</li>
<li>Portions of federal data were opened to the public</li>
</ol>
<p>This third phase represents a milestone in Tim’s career when&nbsp;Megan Smith, the Chief Technical Officer of the United States, learned about the DAP dashboard. Recognizing its potential importance, Smith encouraged the immediate development of the DAP platform for the public. Two months later <a href=""https://analytics.usa.gov/"">Analytics.USA.gov</a> was born.</p>
<p>It should be clear that Tim is an enterprising individual. That adventurous spirit extends beyond work and into his personal life. A returned Peace Corps volunteer, Tim enjoys trying new things in his spare time. From curling (yes, that kind of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOk9SVzqHsk"">curling</a>) to cuisine, you can always count on Tim for a new story about his latest escapade.</p>

<!--more--><p>We recently performed an evaluation on 1.USA.gov, a URL shortening solution we’ve operated with Bitly since 2010, and found that the number of people who use the service is declining, and that the general sentiment towards the service can best be described as ambivalence. &nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the nature of using short URLs is changing. &nbsp;Social media services, such as Twitter, are changing how they treat links. Users are getting better at looking at the context of the information provided with a link as well as its source to judge its trustworthiness, as opposed to just looking at the link’s domain. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result of this evaluation, and our own strategic roadmap, we have decided to &nbsp;deactivate the service on June 30, 2016. &nbsp;Existing 1.USA.gov short URLs will continue to work after this time, but newly shorted government URLs on Bitly.com will be normal bit.ly short URLs as opposed to 1.USA.gov short URLs.</p>
<p>By shutting down the service, we’ll be able to shift our resources to further developing our other products, which we feel will allow us to serve the public in more beneficial and direct ways than continuing to operate 1.USA.gov.</p>

<p>The Marketing Team set out to learn more about our audiences and the kind of content they like. Despite being a difficult platform to navigate, we set lofty goals for ourselves and developed a timely strategy to pin everyday.</p>
<h3>A year in…</h3>
<p>Twelve months later, our metrics are up and we correctly calculated that a shift to educational content would be key. However, Pinterest is still a challenge to predict. Unlike Twitter and Facebook, it’s difficult to identify trends. Despite all that, we have seen substantial growth in followers and content consumption, even taking into account our ambitious goals.</p>

<h3>Lessons learned</h3>
<p>Perhaps the biggest lesson came from one of our early predictions. Like with other Kids.gov social media accounts, summer is the low season. Fewer teachers look for educational resources when there’s no school. By adapting our content by season, we were able to provide timely information to our followers. During summer break when kids were off from school, we focused on parents and caretakers. Once the fall arrived, we switched back to educational content for schools and teachers. This strategy was key to our success. Here are a few other things we picked up along the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike other platforms all the action takes place at night, peaking around 9 PM.</li>
<li>Our primary audience (teachers) takes the summer off.</li>
<li>Infographics are more popular than on other platforms.</li>
<li>Vertical images perform much better than horizontal&nbsp;ones.</li>
<li>Health, history, and money related topics perform the best.</li>
<li>Posts have a longer lifespan compared to Twitter and Facebook.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our hope moving forward is to learn more about the Pinterest audience and begin to predict certain topics and when they will be popular. Pinterest is still a challenge to our marketing team, but one we gladly approach and look forward to understanding. &nbsp;</p>

Schneider</em></p>
<!--more--><p>The Social and Behavioral Science Team (SBST) is a small, but mighty group of leading behavioral scientists and innovators from across the country. Housed within the Office of Evaluation Sciences at GSA, the SBST realizes that “seemingly small barriers to engagement...can prevent programs from effectively reaching the people they are intended to serve” and that “an effective and efficient government must, therefore, reflect our best understanding of human behavior.”</p>
<p>In order to create a better government, the SBST looks for opportunities in four aspects of program design:</p>
<ol>
<li>Streamlining access to programs and benefits</li>
<li>Improving how government presents information to consumers, borrowers, and program beneficiaries</li>
<li>Enhancing how government presents and structures choices within programs</li>
<li>Examining the frequency, presentation, and labeling of benefits, tax credits, and other incentives</li>
</ol>
<p>The powerful impact of these focus areas became evident during SBST’s collaboration with us on the <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/learning-how-to-build-a-better-front-door-for-the-federal-government"">Federal Front Door initiative</a>. Together we were able to streamline benefits and help agencies appropriately collaborate to address common, shared experiences in the public space. By considering the everyday life of our customers we’re better able to transform disjointed agencies into a more singular federal resource.</p>
<p>By partnering with agencies, the Social and Behavioral Science Team can help provide dynamic solutions. As USAGov continues to evolve in pursuit of our mission to create and organize timely, needed government information and services and make them accessible to the public anytime, anywhere, via their channel of choice, we’ll continue to tap SBST’s insight into human behavior.</p>

USAGov Blog,Quantitative Research on Kids.gov,Quantitative Research on Kids.gov,en,/blog/2016/06/quantitative-research-on-kids-gov,dcward,"Performance and Analytics,User Experience and Accessibility",Quantitative Research on Kids.gov,2016-06-01 00:00:00,2023-06-13T21:21:00.206Z,"<p>As part of USAGov’s efforts to assess and improve Kids.gov, we reviewed a variety of metrics to get a clearer understanding of how visitors have been using the site. This data--in combination with the qualitative research--is helping to guide our recommendations for the website.</p>
<!--more--><p>The data was pulled from Google Analytics, DigitalGov Search, Google’s Webmaster Tools, Facebook, Twitter, and our email service provider.</p>
<p>Here’s a snapshot of some of the quantitative data we reviewed and what we took from it:</p>
<h3>Web Visits and Return Users</h3>
<p>We compared Kids.gov visits during the same months of different years (2014-2016) and observed an increasing trend during in-school months with an average increase of 15%. About 27% of visitors were classified as return users. Our overall takeaway was that there is an increasing demand for Kids.gov content.</p>
<h3>Pageviews and External Link Usage</h3>
<p>In reviewing pageviews and external links, we identified the most and least popular content. We found that sections for teens and teachers were being heavily used while the content intended for parents got relatively low traffic. Lesson plans, videos, games, and subjects covering careers and branches of government got a lot of use. This data also showed us that a huge percentage of external links (about 72%) were rarely clicked, which provided a good argument for drastically reducing &nbsp;our lists of link.</p>
<h3>Traffic Sources</h3>
<p>About 61% of traffic to Kids.gov came from search. Other major sources were USA.gov and email subscribers. The site also got a lot of referrals from government sources and education-related entities. The many referrals from individual schools, school districts, classrooms, and libraries reinforced the idea that the audience for Kids.gov is primarily teachers and students.</p>
<h3>Device Use</h3>
<p>Approximately &nbsp;15% of Kids.gov users came to the site on a mobile device. This is much lower than on our other sites, which are mobile friendly. Of those who did use mobile devices on Kids.gov, we found that they had a higher bounce rate, visited fewer pages, had shorter visits, and didn’t return as often as desktop and tablet users. These findings verified our belief &nbsp;that mobile experience on Kids.gov is not a good one; and it supported our intention to make all of our products easily available to visitors from any device.</p>
<h3>Search</h3>
<p>Data from Google and DigitalGov Search showed a clear difference between what people were searching for on Kids.gov versus what brought them to Kids.gov from Google. Based on the site search queries for terms like “Pok√©mon” and “Pac-Man,” it would appear that those searches were entered by kids or teens. However, the terms that brought visitors to Kids.gov from Google--terms like lesson plans, book report, and science videos--were more likely to be teachers or parents.</p>
<h3>Email</h3>
<p>We reviewed data on about 600 email messages sent to subscribers over the past two years. Each message was put into a topic bucket. Messages categorized for teachers had the highest open rate, followed by messages on reading and writing. Two of the top three messages included “lesson plan” in the subject line. Emails on &nbsp;math and online safety had the lowest open rates.</p>
<h3>Social Media</h3>
<p>We reviewed data on more than 1,400 Tweets, 1,000 Facebook posts, and 80 videos. What held true in email didn’t necessarily hold true for &nbsp;Twitter, Facebook, or YouTube. On Twitter, reading, writing, and math had the highest engagement rate (calculated as: total engagements/impressions). However, one of the highest rated Tweets [about snowflakes] was in the science category.</p>
<p>On Facebook, online safety and math had the highest engagement rate (calculated as: engagement/reach). Art, music, and science had the lowest engagement rates. The Facebook post with the highest engagement rate was about educational video games for kids.</p>
<p>We measured videos by views. A field trip to the money factory ranked #1. Other high-ranking videos were spotlights on careers in archeology, veterinary medicine, and physical therapy.</p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>As we look at this data in combination with survey comments, interviews, market research, staffing, and budget restrictions, we’re developing options and recommendations for Kids.gov. Check in with us again as we share the outcome.</p>

This final installment talks about where we go from here.</em></p>
<!--more-->
<p>A rebrand doesn’t end once the new name is in place. Even after we chose the name USAGov and designed a new logo, there was still plenty of work to be done.</p>
<p>In September 2015, we held an event to unveil the new brand to internal staff, complete with a training session about brands and an exercise to explore the personality and attributes of USAGov. We also created a<a href=""https://youtu.be/SdlVbBllr9I"">video</a> to tell our story to both external and internal audiences, and we developed the new <a href=""http://usa.gov/explore"">USA.gov/explore</a> bilingual landing page to introduce the public, our partners, and other government agencies to USAGov.</p>
<p>Throughout this rebranding journey, it’s become clear that our brand starts with our team, our shared values, and our mission. So it’s important that everyone on our team can articulate what we stand for, how we serve the public, and what we offer. We all need to tell the story of USAGov.</p>
<p>And we’re helping to communicate that story by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating and distributing useful, relevant, educational content that shows the public what our brand is all about and what the brand stands for</li>
<li>Engaging our GSA colleagues about our new brand, so we can all consistently convey who we are and all that we can do to serve the public</li>
<li>Reaching out to partner organizations at other federal agencies, along with individual influencers, to introduce our comprehensive new platform and explore opportunities for collaboration</li>
<li>Integrating our new parent brand into our online and offline properties by refreshing the logos and branding language for channels such as<a href=""http://usa.gov"">USA.gov</a>, GobiernoUSA.gov, and our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/USAgov/"">social media properties</a>. These new logos align with the USAGov brand and now appear at the top of our websites, on the <a href=""http://connect.usa.gov/learn-more-about-snap?ecid=ACsprvuIwF3S5z8UXN6A0zAAKvip_-wG245zK6_AHqRTtxDjfLI7I2cctJNdmf3fUP-Zp8XA4RwD&amp;utm_campaign=%2B+Benefits%2C+Grants+and+Loans&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=29673123&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_Glp2WRyKYz4dM4ALfkFeK8-rg63wPRhe1d2t-bGznND9KlnFBBnMqfmz5kqH0OKRFt6PzL11dcx3TNcY11r1k6U7anw&amp;_hsmi=29673123"">e-mail messages</a> we send out, and on printed materials such as the Consumer Action Handbook and fact sheets.</li>
<li>Updating the bilingual landing page at<a href=""http://usa.gov/explore"">USA.gov/explore</a> on a regular basis — to either highlight new content or a new campaign, or to capture page visitors by offering an e-mail sign-up box</li>
</ul>
<p>A year ago, some people knew us as the Federal Citizen Information Center. Others knew us by one of our various channels — USA.gov, or GobiernoUSA.gov, or Kids.gov, or Publications.USA.gov, or our contact center. Our new parent brand — USAGov — clarifies that we’re all one team, on one mission together, guiding people to the government services and information they can trust to help make life a little easier.</p>

Our cross-functional team has joined forces to “reenvision” the site’s content and presentation to be sure that we’re doing our best to meet the needs of our current audience.</p>
<!--more--><p>While the site analytics and secondary market research teams provided information that was incredibly valuable and informative, we were still missing some pieces of the puzzle - the actual voices of parents, teachers, and kids.</p>
<h3>Why We Used Qualitative Research Methods</h3>
<p>There’s no substitute for quantitative research to give you real information on audience behavior, but for this project, we wanted a richer picture. So we dug a bit deeper to learn some things that the data can’t tell us. We used our interviews to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify customer needs</li>
<li>Discover and discuss ideas for potential new features</li>
<li>Explore potential strategic directions for branding or communications programs</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Did</h3>
<p>For this project, we conducted 9 interviews, each approximately 30 minutes in length, with parents, teachers, and kids. Our interviews were conducted in-person and over the phone, and our interviewees live across the United States, many far outside the beltway.</p>
<h3>What We Learned</h3>
<p>Here are some initial findings from our interviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>All but one interviewee was unaware that Kids.gov exists, but none had ever visited the site.</li>
<li>Teachers face a great deal of challenges meeting the needs of a diverse student body. They are time and resource constrained and frequently look for materials to teach lessons. They need primary materials, like lesson plans, and supplementary materials to support a lesson, like worksheets, crafts, and activities. Materials need to come from a reliable source, and they need to be free of charge.</li>
<li>Younger children (&lt;8th grade), don’t frequently use the internet for help with homework. When the kids do use the internet for homework assistance, it’s usually for help with math problems.</li>
<li>Parents spend more time helping younger kids with homework, and math problems are a consistent area of focus.</li>
<li>It’s common for parents to use the internet to look for health and developmental information to care for and support their children.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>A full report of our findings will be shared with the team and used to provide a layer of audience awareness to the data analysis and market research.</p>
<p><em>Look for our final installment of the Kids.gov Reenvisioning series following the project’s completion.</em></p>

In the wake of our rebranding efforts, our desire to create a positive user experience across the organization has pushed us to turn a scrutinous eye toward <a href=""https://kids.usa.gov/"">Kids.gov</a> -- a site focused on providing information and resources to parents, teachers, and kids. In a cross-organizational effort, individuals from the marketing, user experience, and performance measurement teams have joined forces to “reenvision” the site’s content and presentation to better suit the public’s needs.</p>
<!--more--><p>In order to accomplish this objective, we broke the project out into three components:</p>
<ol>
<li>Site analytics - internal data metrics</li>
<li>Primary research - interviewing our stakeholders</li>
<li>Secondary research - competitive analysis/market research</li>
</ol>
<p>Once each group has completed its review, the task force will scrutinize the findings and develop actionable recommendations. This could include changing content, layout,&nbsp;the focus/vision of the program,&nbsp;or even eliminating the&nbsp;site.</p>
<p>Today we’ll focus on the secondary research team and the steps they’re taking to understand Kids.gov users.</p>
<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>We identified 4 major audiences: kids, parents, teachers, and librarians. From there we considered demographic information that could affect the way each group collected and consumed information. For example, age and socioeconomic status were factors that commonly had an impact.</p>
<p><em>Teachers under age 35 are more likely than teachers age 55 and older to describe themselves as “very confident” when it comes to using new digital technologies (64% vs. 44%)</em> - <a href=""http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/02/28/how-teachers-are-using-technology-at-home-and-in-their-classrooms/"">Pew Research Center</a></p>
<p><em>Parents living in households with an annual income of less than $50,000 are somewhat more likely to come across useful parenting advice with greater frequency –10% do so “frequently” compared with 4% of higher-income parents on social media.</em> - <a href=""http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/07/16/seeking-parenting-advice-on-social-media/"">Pew Research Center</a></p>
<p>We used research from this phase of our analysis to inform our understanding of stakeholder needs and expectations.</p>
<h3>Customer Needs</h3>
<p>With a new knowledge of who our customers are, the secondary research team focused in on identifying customer needs, expectations, and their habits relating to certain products and services. From there, we then broadened our scope to evaluate how we compare among top commercial and government competitors. Using tools like Google page rankings and SEMrush (a competitive intelligence suite for online marketing), we were able to gain a clearer picture. For example, information on school grants and funding, a common teacher request, is addressed by a number of other government sites, including <a href=""http://www.ed.gov/"">ed.gov</a> and <a href=""http://www.grants.gov/"">grants.gov</a>. At the same time Kids.gov failed to register in the top 250 Google results for keywords searches pertaining to this stakeholder need.</p>
<h3>Moving Forward</h3>
<p>As we enter the final stage of research prior to developing a report for USAGov directors, we will perform a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis. Doing so will help inform questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there functional areas we should eliminate?</li>
<li>Is there content we should give more attention to?</li>
<li>Where do we add value?</li>
<li>What are our niches?</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to serve a dynamic nation, we must be a dynamic content provider.</p>

In support of this belief, USAGov’s Sarah Crane recently spoke at an EPA sponsored conference in Crystal City. Her presentation entitled, “The Future of Digital Government: The Next Big Things” focused on the following key topics:</p>
<!--more-->
<h3>Adaptive Content</h3>
<p>Content that is structured, tagged, and managed free from presentation. Adaptive content is often made available via API for re-use. While this strategy allows for easy repurposing (for mobile, syndication, etc.) it demands another team or person to think about presentation and findability of the content.</p>
<h3>Agile Content</h3>
<p>Product management ideals in content development and enhancement</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iteration</strong>
<ul>
<li>Content must be fluid to match changing circumstance &nbsp;</li>
<li>Reject “lorem ipsum” in favor of specific sample content in wireframes or prototypes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Product Management</strong>
<ul>
<li>From the beginning, content is at the heart of the agile process</li>
<li>Allows for faster decisions when identifying new products/services</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>People</strong>
<ul>
<li>Full ownership of a product/service reduces hierarchy and creates a sense of empowerment</li>
<li>Accountable for success, accountable for failure</li>
<li>“Lifecycle ownership” results in more user-centric product management</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Findability</h3>
<p>“The ease with which users can find information from outside or inside a site.” Realizing that findability is much more than just “search” has become increasingly important. With more users entering a site through a channel other than the homepage, building a team to consider taxonomy, IA, SEO, and orientation, in order to create a consistent experience, has become paramount.</p>
<h3>Platforms</h3>
<p>A platform is a system that can be customized/adapted by outside developers and users. Facebook provides an excellent commercial example of this idea. A widely popular platform, &nbsp;Facebook has seen a number of extraneous applications built on top of it from Farmville to Words with Friends. <a href=""https://federalist.18f.gov/"">Federalist</a> is another, government sponsored platform example. Developed to create a unified interface for publishing static government websites, Federalist offers “completely custom templates that take advantage of [a] scalable static site architecture and web-based editor.”</p>
<h3>Online Marketplaces</h3>
<p>A type of site where products or services are provided by multiple parties, but the transactions are processed by the marketplace operator. Commercial examples of this include Amazon and Etsy, while apps.gov is a governmental equivalent that allows agencies to shop and compare cloud security providers.</p>
<h3>On Demand Services</h3>
<p>Demand services provide convenience and efficiency. Examples of this demand-based production model include Uber, DoorDash, and Instacart. Though certainly an increasingly popular trend, its implications on the future of digital government are not yet clear.</p>
<h3>Civic Tech Partnerships</h3>
<p>In today’s society, almost every major commercial tech shop has a public affairs/public policy branch. Within the government we must continue to work with and leverage these groups, and the amplifying platforms they support, in order to deliver our content to the public. <a href=""https://vote.usa.gov/"">Vote.gov</a> is a successful example of such a partnership. After launching Vote.gov, Facebook’s civic engagement team facilitated a joint effort to make voters more aware of upcoming registration deadlines.</p>
<p>Though USAGov has not fully adopted these upcoming trends, we continue to monitor them for possible incorporation into our model.</p>

Stronger. Easier. More-efficient. Like many other civil servants with a passion for improving the government, Mary Ann Monroe has lofty goals for GSA and the federal government as a whole. Despite the illustrious nature of these ambitions, however, under Mary Ann’s tenure, OCSIT has seen a marked improvement and progression towards these objectives. In her newly appointed role as chief-of-staff she will further assist USAGov in its pursuit of even higher aspirations.</p>
<!--more--><p>Joining GSA in October of 2011, Mary Ann has been a part of foundational changes in the way we do business. During the past five years she has witnessed siloed programs evolve into a customer-centric organization with integrated teams focused on making data driven decisions for USAGov.</p>
<p>But how did we make the transition? Our people.</p>
<p>To quote Mary Ann, our people are the “best part of who we are and they’re the ones who work together to move us forward.” In OCSIT/18F we have a great team who understands that you have to change, grow, and try new things to stay relevant and bring value to the public’s experience with government. In an effort to meet our customers’ expectations, we’ve:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Done research with the public to learn more about their perception of the government.</li>
 <li>Educated ourselves on the voice of customer (VOC) and applied consistent measurement across OCSIT programs and services.</li>
 <li>Used data to drive improvements in our products and services.</li>
 <li>Completed analyses across office programs about our customers.
  <ul>
   <li>Who are they?</li>
   <li>What methods of feedback did we have in place to hear from them?</li>
   <li>How were we using that feedback to drive improvements in our products and services?</li>
  </ul> </li>
 <li>Established a customer experience index.</li>
 <li>OCSIT/18F programs now evaluate VOC using a set of core questions.</li>
 <li>Used to improve our ability to benchmark across our products/services. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Preliminary work, such as that listed above has helped us elevate the conversation about our customers/users and incorporate customer data in our decision making. &nbsp;As a result of these endeavors, we have made tangible improvements -- from how we offer contact center services, to enhancements on our USA.gov website, to digital content improvements, and interactive voice response system re-engineering. Despite the considerable changes in our organization over the last two years, Mary Ann reminds us that continued evaluation and innovation is necessary to provide valuable and relevant services to the public.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Mary Ann’s passion for growth and improvement extends beyond her work and into her leadership role. Her experience with the Excellence in Government Fellowship taught her the importance of leading by example, the power of collaboration, the art of <em>listening</em>, and perhaps most importantly the “tremendous strength in the people you work with.” She strives to implement these lessons in her everyday interactions and to supplement them with podcasts, blogs, and books on leadership. Her recent favorite TED talk is Reshma Saujani’s “Teach Girls Bravery, Not Perfection.” &nbsp;This TED talk posits that it’s critical we teach young girls to embrace imperfection and be comfortable with taking risks, to be brave and know it’s okay to make mistakes. &nbsp;This is how girls and women learn that success is achieved through perseverance and imperfection.</p>
<p>Mary Ann’s desire to grow as a leader has undoubtedly culminated in her new role as chief of staff. Donning two hats, she will aid in creating a more product-driven organization. Her new position will focus on providing support and communication to our teams, assisting in change management, and investing time in developing relationships with partner agencies and in the private sector in order to collaborate and continue to look for ways to improve the public’s experience with government. With agile methods, new approaches to managing work and operations, and adding products to our Public Experience portfolio, Mary Ann will help shepherd in the next generation for the Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies.</p>

USAGov Blog,The USAGov Bilingual Style Guide Is Now Online!,The USAGov Bilingual Style Guide Is Now Online!,en,/blog/2016/04/the-usagov-bilingual-style-guide-is-now-online,dcward,"Design and Development,Multilingual",The USAGov Bilingual Style Guide Is Now Online!,2016-04-12 00:00:00,2023-06-13T21:36:58.471Z,"<p>About a year and a half ago, the Federal Citizen Information Center - today called USAGov, embarked on a very ambitious task: integrating our content operations. &nbsp;We blurred lines that defined silos and adopted a bilingual content approach to offer a more consistent experience, regardless of language preference or point of access to our information. See <a href=""http://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/05/12/video-blog-sarah-crane-usa-gov/"">more about our rebirth</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As we were figuring out our new content model, we saw the need to reinvent our style guidelines to reflect our new organization. So we did our research. &nbsp;We looked at the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide"">UK Style Guide</a>, the Canadian City of Surrey Style Guide, and several others. &nbsp;We were on the right track to create one place where all guidance would reside, in both languages, and that's how the USAGov Bilingual Style Guide was born.</p>
<h3>What was the process?</h3>
<p>The first step was to assemble a small cross-functional team to make sure we included all aspects of content creation. &nbsp;The team included bilingual digital and print content writers and editors as well as accessibility and marketing folks. &nbsp;Next, we started crafting a structure to the Guide that could easily translate to online publication - our ultimate goal. &nbsp;For the guidance to be effective, it had to be inclusive of both languages - we did not want separate online locations for English and Spanish. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The skeleton was simple. Start by defining: purpose, voice, and tone, and move to areas such as writing for the web, plain language, SEO, accessibility, and marketing. &nbsp;Each expert provided the pieces we needed to incorporate in each area to give the writers sufficient guidance to keep the platform consistent but not cramp their individual style. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>How did we handle English and Spanish?</h3>
<p>Simple. &nbsp;A lot of the guidance applies to both languages, so if there is no specific Spanish call out, the team knows to apply the same guidance across the board. &nbsp;When we do need specifics for the Spanish language, such as numbers, capitalization rules, etc., we include that guidance in that section under a ""Spanish"" subheading. &nbsp;See separate Spanish guidance in the Capitalization section as an example.</p>
<p>We wanted to share this process with you. &nbsp;So, take a look and come back from time to time as we add new sections and update existing guidance. &nbsp;The USAGov Bilingual Style Guide is a living tool that reflects the evolving nature of languages.</p>

As part of USAGov’s effort to do just that, we produce the <strong>Consumer Action Handbook</strong> (CAH) and the <strong>Guía del Consumidor</strong> in Spanish. This publication empowers people to make informed purchases, avoid fraud, and exercise their consumer rights. More than a textbook, the CAH is actionable. We do the legwork, aggregating the resources from across government and the private sector. &nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<h3>Collect</h3>
<p>Over the course of the year, we keep a spreadsheet of potential topics for inclusion in the CAH. These potential topics may be new government websites, like <a href=""https://www.identitytheft.gov/"">Identitytheft.gov</a>, or programs that launched, like <a href=""http://www.consumerfinance.gov/owning-a-home"">CFPB’s Owning a Home</a>, that would be helpful to the public. We also read hundreds of news stories, about consumers facing poor customer service, deceptive clauses hidden in the finest of print, or fraudulent offers that seem too good to be true.</p>
<p>Not all consumer issues are addressed at the federal level. Some issues are regulated by states (insurance and lemon laws). Even so, sometimes new trends happen faster than government agencies can act on them. Plus we have to keep up with scammers, who are quick on their feet. We consider and incorporate all of these factors as part of the consumer marketplace.</p>
<p>Real people provide great insights. Last summer we had the opportunity to hold three consumer focus groups (two in English, one in Spanish). These honest conversations revealed more about the issues people were facing than we could have imagined. Combined with the letters we regularly receive, they re-enforced how crucial it is that the CAH include practical tips that help people prevent problems and get real solutions.</p>
<h3>Distill</h3>
<p>If we included all the information from the collection stage, the <strong>Consumer Action Handbook</strong> would be gigantic, and not very usable. So our next big task is narrowing down all the potential topics to the ones we’ll actually include. In evaluating topics we ask ourselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this topic apply to a wide segment of the population?</li>
<li>Is there a recurring theme around this topic?</li>
<li>Is there an actionable component - is there an action we can advise readers to take or avoid?</li>
<li>Can we provide value?</li>
<li>Can we fill an information gap that hasn’t been filled by any other agency? This is especially true with scams and new consumer technologies.</li>
<li>Is it timely? And on the flip side, will this issue still be relevant when the CAH is printed next year?</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to evaluating potential new topics, we use these criteria to re-evaluate the content from the previous edition, to determine which topics to eliminate.</p>
<h3>Write</h3>
<p>The information needs of CAH readers varies drastically. We have to account for the variation in our readers’ education, reading comprehension level, consumer experience, technical savvy, susceptibility to frauds, and access to resources.</p>
<p>To write new content about a topic, we have to put all the puzzle pieces together to tell a comprehensive story. Each resource we find may focus on one portion of the topic or only highlight one tool. So we incorporate pieces from all the resources into one succinct piece of content on the subject, featuring the best insights from articles, agencies resources, and focus groups.</p>
<p>The most recent edition of the CAH includes forty new articles on topics ranging from chip and pin credit cards, medical billing, credit card cracking, and what to do after a data breach. Luckily we don’t have to start fresh every time; the text from the previous edition is our starting point, but some content has to be dropped to make room for the new.</p>
<h3>Layout and Design</h3>
<p>If compiling several pieces of content is a part of a puzzle exercise, then the CAH page layout is another, part mental, part visual and spacial. We adhere to master pages and styles to make the layout consistent. Within these parameters, however, we constantly struggle to make all the content fit, by aligning adjacent sections, using iterative page shifts, moving text frames, and changing spacing and entire sections to accommodate the text.</p>
<p>We use highlighted text boxes to draw attention to the articles we want to get the most attention. The boxes along with bold “Beware” headlines serve as visual cues to draw attention to the new content. New consumer trends and scams, like crowdfunding or juice jacking, are more timely, while some things, such as credit reports or medical billing are evergreen, always relevant and necessary.</p>
<p>From focus groups, we know that most people use the handbook to deal with one specific problem at a time. &nbsp;To account for this, we have several features to help readers navigate the book, including a table of contents, page headers, right hand page tabs, and an exhaustive index. We also incorporate cross references to other related sections (e.g. a cross reference to auto insurance from the buying a car section) to help readers find complementary information. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Since a pdf will be available on USA.gov, the CAH must also adhere to the Section 508 accessibility standards. Thankfully, we bake accessibility into the book layout as we go along. For example, the signature color of the book has to be dark enough so that gradations that are used as background shading in the boxes have enough of a contrast. This consistent use of design styles, master pages, content tags, alternate text for images, and other tools to make the reading order more logical when we export to PDF.</p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>After the layout is complete, the book is peer reviewed for style consistency, grammar, language, clarity, layout, and a review of accuracy. I will spare you the in depth nitty-gritty details of checking page number references and creating an index. Just know that making cross referencing doable for readers and increasing the usability is something that people in the focus group liked about the book.</p>

If you can’t wait to get a copy, download the pdf&nbsp;in <a href=""http://publications.usa.gov/USAFileDnld.php?PubType=P&amp;PubID=5131&amp;httpGetPubID=0"">English</a> or <a href=""http://publications.usa.gov/USAFileDnld.php?PubType=P&amp;PubID=8202&amp;httpGetPubID=0"">Spanish</a> now.</p>

<!--more--><h3>What’s next?</h3>
<p>Our research confirmed what many of us have observed in less formal settings: People want the government to treat them with respect. As they interact with various agencies, they want clear communication, insight into the processes they’re entering into, and the ability to quickly and easily access the information they need.</p>
<p>In the next phase of our project, we’ll focus on finding innovative answers to these questions:</p>
<ul>
 <li>How might we make digital channels more desirable for people who can use them, thereby reserving non-digital channels for those who most need them?</li>
 <li>How can we open the black box of government and give people better transparency into their status with an agency or process?</li>
 <li>How can we rebuild public trust in government services and tools?</li>
 <li>How can we create ways for agencies to safely and quickly share people’s information (when people so authorize)?</li>
 <li>How can we provide enough choices to the public without overwhelming them?</li>
 <li>How can we better inform the public about what services are available to them?</li>
 <li>What could we do to better meet people where they are, instead of expecting them to come to us?</li>
</ul>
<p>Recognizing the interplay between life events, digital access and literacy, and attitudes toward the government is just our first step in offering the public better resources. Informed by the knowledge that complex or opaque interactions with agencies can worsen the stress of life events, we can move forward in designing services that are accessible, transparent, and easy for all to use.</p>

After weeks of testing the tool to iron out kinks and <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/our-step-by-step-guide-to-making-snapchat-stories-as-accessible-as-possible"">determine how we’d make content accessible</a>, we were excited to go public when the official government-friendly terms of service were signed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So now you may be asking, why is the U.S. government using Snapchat and what will it be sharing?</p>
<p>Here are our top three reasons for using Snapchat.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Explosive growth and audience potential.</strong> According to <a href=""https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/01/11/whitehouse-joins-snapchat"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">the White House blog</a>, 60 percent of Americans ages 13-34 are on Snapchat. There are more than 100 million daily active users. With an engaged audience that large, it was time for us to adopt the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Meeting our audience where they are.</strong> Snapchat is the go-to platform for a younger generation. Right now we know our general user demographic trends older, and we struggle to connect with the younger demographic through our current social media channels. But millennials also need government benefits and services (getting a license, registering to vote, understanding and applying for federal student aid). We want to meet them where they are.</li>
<li><strong>Putting a human face to USAGov.</strong> The government can seem like a big bureaucracy to many people who interact with it. We want to use Snapchat to give the government more of a human face. We’ll be showing behind-the-scenes looks at the people and places that make our government run and help deliver services and benefits to the public. If you want historical fun facts, insider peeks at our national monuments and even the occasional helpful hint, make sure to follow us on Snapchat by searching for USAGov. &nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h3>How we plan to measure success</h3>
<p>We never launch on a new platform without first thinking through how we’ll measure whether we’re successful.</p>
<p>Snapchat provides some very basic information that we’ll be using to track our success:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Followers:</strong> We’ll measure our audience size after six months and assess growth. Are we seeing new followers being added or are people unfollowing us?</li>
<li><strong>Views/Completion Rate:</strong> Snapchat lets you see how many people are watching your story and where they drop off in the process. We’ll measure those numbers to determine if people are watching the whole story or giving up halfway through. We’ll also analyze what kind of content performs best so that we can deliver more of what our audience wants.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement:</strong> We’ll look at the number of people who send Snaps back to us to help determine how engaging our content is.</li>
<li><strong>Screenshots: </strong>Snapchat notifies you when someone takes a screenshot of your content. We’ll use screenshots to help us determine if we’re sharing important information that our audience thinks is worth keeping. We’ll look at what kind of content is screenshotted the most to learn what’s important to our followers.</li>
</ul>

<!--more--><h3>Sharing personal information</h3>
<h4>The desire for privacy exists on a spectrum</h4>
<p>Generally speaking, our interviewees understand that applying for a service or benefit &nbsp;requires them to share personal information. This includes general, identifying information, such as name and date of birth, along with interaction-specific information. &nbsp;</p>
<p>How they feel about providing that information is a bit of a mixed bag. Most of the people we spoke to are willing to share their information when it provides a clear benefit to them, though not everyone holds this view. Based on our interviews, we identified three primary attitudes people hold on sharing their information with the government. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A small group of people we spoke to trust the government implicitly with their data and have no problem sharing their personal information. More than one person we interviewed said, “I have nothing to hide.” In general, this group trusts that the government is working in their favor and wants it to have the information it needs to perform its job well, even if requested information isn’t directly related to the process at hand.</p>
<p>Most of the people we interviewed generally trust the government with their data but only want to provide the information necessary to apply for a service or benefit. They don’t want to give the government information it doesn’t need, but have no problem providing information if doing so will benefit them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Others want to avoid providing their information to the government as much as possible, and may avoid applying for services or benefits if it means providing a lot of personal information to an agency. When they do provide their information, they’d like to know why it’s being requested and how it’s going to be used. They &nbsp;worry that the government will use their own information against them in the future.</p>
<p>Although many people accept that they need to share information — sometimes very personal information — with the government, their acceptance shouldn’t be mistaken for eagerness. Most people would prefer forms collect less information and do so more judiciously.</p>
<h4>Information sharing between agencies</h4>
<p>The majority of our interviewees reported frustration at having to provide the same information over and over. In most cases, people don’t understand (or aren’t interested in) the technological or policy restrictions that prevent agencies from sharing data —&nbsp;they are simply annoyed at repeated requests for the same information. &nbsp;When a person has to interact with multiple agencies at once — for example, applying for unemployment and food stamps at the same time — and those agencies can’t pass basic information to each other, that person will have to answer the same questions many times over.</p>
<p>Those who are suspicious and private would prefer that agencies never share their information, even if it means they have to provide the same information repeatedly to different agencies. Some assume that government agencies already share their information and are resigned to the prospect that their information might be passed from one agency to another.</p>
<p>Alvaro S., who fills out the same government form every six months to receive benefits, doesn’t understand why the government asks for information it already has — or should have — in its system. Likewise, a college student in Jacksonville said the government’s financial aid forms are extremely repetitive.</p>
<p>When we presented hypothetical scenarios that would allow for more and easier information sharing among agencies, participants voiced broad and often enthusiastic support. Interviewees who had imported their income information from the IRS when filling out the FAFSA appreciated the ease of the flow and the reduced risk of error. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, participants expressed their desire to limit cross-agency information sharing. People want some amount of control over when and how their information is used. They’re especially wary of the government sharing information with private-sector organizations, and they generally want the ability to opt into or out of how their information is shared.</p>
<p>Interestingly, people had fewer concerns about information security and privacy controls within the government. Our interviewees &nbsp;seemed to have more trust in government rather than in the private sector.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>In its current form, Snapchat isn’t a highly accessible platform. This isn’t a problem that’s unique to Snapchat. Many emerging technologies are not up to government accessibility standards, which poses a challenge for the innovative agencies that want to adopt them.</p>
<p>However after seeing <a href=""https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/01/11/whitehouse-joins-snapchat"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">the explosive growth of Snapchat</a> over the years, we decided it was time to figure out how to address these accessibility issues, so that government agencies could use the app.</p>
<p>Here’s our step-by-step guide for improving Snapchat accessibility.</p>
<ol>
<li>Plan your Snapchat story with accessibility in mind. Use the platform to tell a succinct story. We recommend storyboarding it before you start, just like you would if you were creating a video. See if the story makes sense from beginning to end and if it clearly communicates the information you’re trying to get across.</li>
<li>Once you’ve created your story, download it in its full form from the Snapchat app. To do that, swipe to the right from the main photo screen. You’ll see your story at the top. Tap the three dots next to “My Story” and click the download arrow. This will save a video file to your phone enabling you to save the Snap story for your records management purposes. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Now comes the fun part: Editing this video file for accessibility. You’ll need to create a captioned audio description and voiceover for the video. This will require some basic audio-recording and video-editing software.</li>
<li>Record your audio first. Make sure the person recording the voiceover speaks slowly and clearly to describe what is happening in the video for those with limited vision.</li>
<li>In the video-editing software, lay down your audio track and then drop your Snapchat video file on top of it. Edit as necessary until your audio and video sync.</li>
<li>Export your completed video file and share it with the world. Make sure to include captions and a text transcript for screen readers. Now people who can’t access your content through the Snapchat app will still be able to experience what you’re sharing.</li>

Today, in the third installment of our ongoing series about our rebranding efforts, we’ll talk about our new logo.</em></p>
<!--more--><p>Building a logo can be like choosing a baby’s name.</p>
<p>Except that there’s at least one key difference: Most parents don’t have the luxury of knowing their baby’s personality before deciding on a first name.</p>
<p>Conversely, most companies know what kind of personality and ethos they want to convey when deciding on the colors, the graphics, and the language that will comprise their logo.</p>
<p>At <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/explore/"">USAGov</a>, we pride ourselves on being trusted and helpful as we work to connect the general public with government information and services. We’re here to help, whether it’s getting a new passport, or finding the correct tax form, or learning about Social Security benefits.</p>
<p>In that same vein, we wanted to convey a personality that was approachable and friendly. And as a federal program, we also wanted to make sure we were coming across as official and trustworthy.</p>
<p>So, after designing, redesigning, narrowing down our choices, and then tweaking, we came up with the logo above.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with the star. To us, it represents the fact that we are a resource from the United States government. But you’ll notice too, that the white part of the star is also a compass needle, representing our role as the “guide” to government information and services.</p>
<p>We chose a clean typography and basic geometric shapes — the circle, the star made of triangles — to try to capture that friendly, approachable feel. And we liked the combination of dark and light blues: the darker blues convey a trusted government feel, and the lighter ones make things a touch more casual, friendly, and modern. (Blue is also the <a href=""https://today.yougov.com/news/2015/05/12/why-blue-worlds-favorite-color/"">world’s favorite color</a>.)</p>
<p>While we are a federal program, we ultimately chose to stay away from adding traditional red to the white and blues. We felt the color might come across as a bit too bold. The blues, we felt, were more stable. And this color pattern, we hope, will help differentiate us.</p>
<p>There is, of course, another consideration when building a logo: Your audience. And in many ways, a logo can be a self-fulfilling prophecy in terms of the people you’re targeting. You probably wouldn’t go into an interview wearing shorts and sandals; nor would you wear a suit and tie to a neighborhood block party. You want your look to speak to the groups you’re trying to reach.</p>
<p>Our audience is extremely broad — from students, to seniors planning for retirement, to people interested in immigrating to the United States, to government partners and agencies. The circle is meant to be inclusive, and unifying, and we hope there is at least one element to this new logo that will speak to everyone.</p>

<!--more--><h3>Trust</h3>
<h4>Trust is reciprocal</h4>
<p>Trust was a theme that figured into most of our conversations. Agencies tend to focus on building public trust in government, but we found that the public views trust as a two-way street: Not only does the public need to trust the government, but the government needs to trust the public.</p>
<h4>Lack of reciprocal trust</h4>
<p>Many people feel that government employees and agencies assume they have negative intentions or that they’re lying, lazy, or a criminal. One person reported feeling like they were guilty until proven innocent.</p>
<p>Consider the experience of one of our interviewees. Velma A., a resident of Jacksonville, applied for Social Security disability benefits twice. Her first application was denied, and so she applied again. She expressed concern that her second application would also be denied —&nbsp;she admitted that she hadn’t fully understood how to answer all of the questions on the application, but she also felt she couldn’t leave any fields blank. “Leaving blanks is like you not really telling the whole story,” she said, “so I filled it in best I could.” She knew her description of her disability wouldn’t be as accurate as that written by a medical professional, and she worried the person reviewing her application would think she was lazy instead of legitimately disabled. The stress of wondering how her application would be perceived compounded Velma’s already stressful situation.</p>
<p>How an agency physically represents itself also plays a huge role in building trust. Jim F.,&nbsp;a senior citizen in Minneapolis, said that visiting a local agency office ""feels like you're visiting someone in prison."" He was put off by the security measures, including the metal detectors, the glass pane between separating him from the government employee, and the metal tray used to send documents back and forth.</p>
<p>These two stories illustrate the government’s presumed lack of trust in the public. If the government were to more explicitly communicate its assumption of the public's needs and positive intent (and design services around both), it could drastically improve public perception.</p>
<h4>Deciding to trust government services</h4>
<p>Our interviewees employed a variety of strategies before deciding to trust a government service.</p>
<p>Many people mentioned that they look for one or more of the following to evaluate the trustworthiness of a digital service:</p>
<ul>
 <li>https</li>
 <li>.gov domains</li>
 <li>Official government logos</li>
 <li>Trust-building language such as “this is an official government website”</li>
</ul>
<p>One of our interviewees, for example, mentioned that he always looks for the .gov URL and assumes a site is OK if he sees that. “As far as I know,” he said, ""government websites can't be spoofed yet.""</p>
<p>Other people need more than just the .gov to trust a site. Karen S. of Kansas City relies on several different clues to assess a government site’s trustworthiness. She told us that she looks at the logos a site uses to determine its validity, and she also looks for an affiliation to departments or agencies she’s aware of. Finally, she said, she bases her trust on whether a site “looks legit.”</p>
<p>Velma A. expressed a sentiment common to several of our interviewees. She feels it’s hard to rely on a fixed set of traits to determine a service’s trustworthiness. This uncertainty, she said, “ [is] why a lot of older people, like my parents are older, don’t trust the internet for nothing.”</p>
<p>People also look for certain trust signifiers in non-digital transactions. Velma A. also mentioned that when she calls a government phone number, she specifically listens for language like, “Thank you for calling the U.S. department of…”</p>
<h4>Government agencies versus private companies</h4>
<p>Other folks aren’t able to differentiate government services from private companies. A man in Minneapolis with three sons told a story about how he paid a fee to fill out the FAFSA for one of his sons. He said, “You have to take the FAFSA test so, I’ll be a little critical, you pay money to be told you don’t qualify. Why don’t they tell you right upfront. If your income is above x, don’t bother paying the fee just to be told you don’t qualify. I found that to be very frustrating and my wife, in the second year, says you need to do that again because you must not have filled it out right. I said I can’t not fill it out right. It’s pretty simple. So I filled it out again, paid the fee — you don’t qualify. I said I’m not filling this out anymore. You pay a fee to be told you don’t qualify doesn’t make any sense whatsoever.”</p>
<p>Since the FAFSA, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, is free to submit, we suspect this man may have been interacting with a private company, or he may have fallen victim to one of the many scams that charge a fee to access (free) government benefits and services.</p>
<h4>Cost-benefit tradeoff</h4>
<p>Most people, before applying for government benefits or using a government service, assess the predicted return on their investment. In most cases, they anticipate that the interaction will be frustrating, and they want to have a sense of whether the benefit they receive will be worth the time and effort. &nbsp;People base these calculations on their past experiences with the government and their level of confidence in navigating government bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Our interviewees reported frustration at filling out complex forms, only to find out they weren’t eligible for the benefit or service in question. Often, disqualifying factors — making too much money the previous year, for example —&nbsp;aren’t clearly communicated up front. When people realize they’re ineligible only after filling out a long application, this lack of clear communication exacerbates their frustration.</p>
<p>We observed a strong relationship between people’s confidence that they’ll get the service they need and their likelihood of applying for it. The less confident a person feels about their prospect of getting a service, the less likely they are to apply.</p>
<p>In some cases, people feel so strongly that they won’t get a service that they won’t even consider applying. Aisha R., for example, feels she can’t adequately prove her income to get a home loan — so she has stopped trying. “I’ve already called the loan people and said this is how much I’ve made for the past couple of years and ... [the loan officer is] like, ‘Nope.’ He already knows before I submit it, so I don’t want to submit all of my paperwork and have them say, ‘Oh, you’re denied.’ I don’t want to spin my wheels on that.”</p>
<p>Other people are more resilient and are willing to persevere until they achieve their goal. A few of our interviewees talked about appealing after being denied benefits; several people we talked to mentioned applying multiple times for unemployment benefits. Danica R. had lost her job three times in the past, but described notable resilience. She filed complaints for two of those three terminations, and went to small claims court for the third. “I’m a fighter,” she said.</p>
<p>“[The process of applying for food stamps in California is] very redundant. It just felt like I was filling out the same information over and over and over again. It would be easier if they just streamlined it. Put your answers in and whoever needs it just takes the information from it.”</p>

<!--more--><h3>The burden of choice overload</h3>
<p>Sometimes, the government presents situations with so many options, it’s hard to know which is the best. To share just one example we heard, one of our interviewees described receiving hundreds of advertisements for Medicare Part C insurance plans. As she leafed through them, she quickly became overwhelmed. She ended up choosing the plan that had the most attractive brochure.</p>
<p>Choice overload comes in another form, too: situations where it’s hard to determine the consequences of picking a particular option. In these situations, people may be selecting from a small number of options, but they’re unable to figure out which will benefit them the most. One interviewee described gathering a group of his closest friends to help him figure out when, given his earnings and health, he should start drawing on social security. Despite their collective knowledge, they had trouble coming to a definitive conclusion. In the end, this person ended up drawing his Social Security benefits when he turned 62. His reasoning was that the program might become insolvent, so he had better take advantage of it while it still existed.</p>
<p>Our interviewees appreciated having tools that made complicated choices easier. Several people mentioned employer-provided Social Security calculators as vital for making decisions about when to draw retirement benefits. Others appreciated when senior center staff broke down the differences between Medicare plan options for them. Participants enjoyed choice, but they wanted help determining which choice was the best for them.</p>

<!--more--><h3>The need for transparency: understanding a process</h3>
<p>Members of the public want to be able to “see” the process they’re undergoing when they’re interacting with federal agencies and programs. This includes knowing when their information has been received and reviewed, understanding all steps in the process from start to finish, and having greater overall clarity into why the process takes as long as it does. People expect to wait, but the reasons why and the causes for delay continue to be a mystery — and continue to erode people’s trust in the government.</p>
<p>People are more comfortable providing their personal information or undergoing difficult processes if they understand why these things are necessary. Interviewees complained of forms asking for personal or sensitive information when it didn’t seem relevant. For example, Danica R. complained about having to provide her son’s new address to HUD when he moved out before age 18. Her relationship with her son was strained, and she didn’t know where he was living at the time. She said, “I was already struggling to maintain the relationship, why do you have to make it harder?” She wondered why telling HUD that he had moved out wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>Alternatively, when the reason for an inconvenience was apparent, people generally had no problem participating. Most people we talked to don’t like the wait and inconvenience at TSA checkpoints, but are willing to make that tradeoff to feel safer when flying.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, people want insight into the process they’re preparing to undertake. They want to know how long a process will take, whether there’s variability in that timeframe, what factors might impact approval or denial, and whom to contact with questions or concerns. Agencies that don’t provide this information — or that provide only some of this information — may unwittingly be eroding their users’ trust.</p>
<h3>Personal and governmental pressures</h3>
<p>When interacting with the federal government, a person may be under considerable pressure. One source of this pressure could be the life event that is triggering the interaction, such as the loss of a job. That said, pressure also results from the government process itself. &nbsp;People worry that they only get one shot to get their paperwork right and that there may be negative consequences for doing something wrong. They also worry when long periods of time pass without updates, and when interactions are difficult. Some may worry &nbsp;that their request might be viewed as fraudulent rather than coming from a place of real need.</p>
<p>One woman in Philadelphia who applied for Medicaid described feeling several of these pressures. She told us, ""It's not embarrassing to tell these people I only make $2,000 a year. It's humiliating because it feels like someone else is evaluating me and judging me and deciding whether I'm really … [undecipherable] getting affordable healthcare, which I think is really gross. ""</p>
<p>Though we can’t eliminate the emotional impact of major life events, we can design services that reduce the stress caused by government processes. This will help rebuild people’s trust in the federal government and encourage them to view the government as an ally rather than an adversary.</p>

Recently, a panel of agency communicators&nbsp;shared tools, strategies, and predictions on how the federal government approaches CX in outreach, marketing, and other different areas.</p>
<!--more--><p>Here are a few things we picked up from the discussion:</p>
<h3>Ban the word “general public” from your vocabulary.</h3>
<p>Drafting content and communication strategies that target the general public is no longer an option. To optimize CX, every audience needs its own approach. Targeting your specific customers will not only increase engagement but improve their experience. Your message and approach should be tailored depending on your audience.</p>
<h3>Embrace new technologies.</h3>
<p>CX is changing everyday. In some cases, almost as fast as technology evolves. The government can’t take a back seat to innovation; it must adapt with the times and with its customers. We’re increasingly seeing .gov sites become mobile accessible in response to the ever-increasing traffic from smartphones, a clear sign of the government’s efforts to be in step as new technologies become available.</p>
<p>Other innovations in this area are new tools and ways to interact with your customers. <a href=""https://www.uscis.gov/emma"">Emma, USCIS’ virtual assistant</a> is a great example of government embracing new technology. The system answers questions based on your own words, not in agency terms or “government speak.” Even though Emma is not a computer learning system, it does provide automatic, real-time answers for customers in need of immigration information from the comfort of their computer.</p>
<h3>Keep up with the times.</h3>
<p>Making sure your brand speaks to all of your audiences is key. USCIS’s Emma is an example of that.</p>
<p>In USAGov’s case, the challenge is unique because our intended demographic includes a larger, less targeted audience. We also provide services to other agencies, so creating a brand that speaks to both groups is a major challenge not only in terms of service, but of communication. USAGov’s new <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/what-s-in-a-name"">branding</a> and image hopes to attract both audiences without having to drastically change its look and ways to communicate with them.</p>
<h3>It’s a team effort.</h3>
<p>CX is something that goes beyond the communications team. It involves a cultural shift throughout the agency, and many other aspects beyond marketing and outreach. Good CX is a responsibility that belongs to everyone in an organization</p>
<p>You can <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DywmfyLpGQo"">watch the full</a> “Good Communication is a CX Imperative” panel and learn about the tools and strategies shared by Leilani Martinez of USAGov, Dave Hebert of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Jeffrey Levy of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS, DHS) and Victoria Wales from USAGov.</p>

<!--more--><p>It’s common to rely on social networks for help during major life events or difficult experiences. As mentioned before, certain populations are more likely to ask friends and family for help accessing government services during major life events. Those who are most likely to rely on others include seniors, non-native English speakers, and people with disabilities. People from these populations often rely on outside support when navigating complex processes.</p>
<p>This guidance-focused relationship extends to getting help with difficult government interactions. For example, Alvaro S. helps his Spanish-speaking parents file their taxes every year, collecting their income information and filling out the online tax forms himself.</p>
<p>When social networks break down, at-risk people can slip through the cracks and lose their ability to effectively seek government support. Low-income seniors and people with disabilities may have limited social networks, and consequently have no one to help them access government services.</p>
<p>Some people will seek assistance elsewhere, asking librarians, senior center staff, and other agency staff to help them with online applications. &nbsp;In many cases, these “helpers” are forbidden by their employers to provide such assistance. When Maria K. visited a career center to file for unemployment benefits, a staff member showed her to a computer and pulled up the online application, but was unable to help her further when she had questions about the application itself. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When government officials refuse to talk to a proxy about a person’s case, that person is often stymied in their efforts to access government services. One woman in Kansas City lives with her parents and helps them with their finances, taxes, benefits — “Everything, everything, everything goes through me right now,"" she said. She doesn’t have —&nbsp;nor does she want — power of attorney, but sometimes agencies won’t speak to her because of that. ""My mom is, is … still well enough to handle any situations,"" she said. ""She's still kicking and in good health, so I don't want to do anything she wouldn't want me to do. So I'd rather her still make the decisions.""</p>

Today, we’ll detail how people learn to navigate government services and what barriers exist to accessing services. If you’re new to the series, <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/learning-how-to-build-a-better-front-door-for-the-federal-government"">start here</a>.</em></p>
<!--more--><p>Whether they’re passively or actively seeking information, people rely on multiple sources to learn how to navigate government services or acquire benefits. A person’s primary source of information undoubtedly shapes their attitude about those interactions.</p>
<p>Among people we interviewed, getting information from a family member or friend was the most common means of learning about government services. We observed that interviewees tended to trust the opinions of people they know who’d had similar experiences. For example, Danica R. in Minneapolis, after being injured in a car accident, learned from her mother and sister that she could apply for Social Security disability benefits. Her mother had previously applied, and her sister was then in the process of applying.</p>
<p>After the advice of friends and family members, people rely heavily on search engines for the information they seek. When we asked interviewees how they found out about a particular service, many of them said they simply “Googled it.” This strategy works well when the search engine pulls up official sources, but can backfire when third-party sites or scammers appear near the top of the results.</p>
<p>People also seek information from third-party sources &nbsp;when government information is unclear. For example, a person might rely on a funeral director to tell them how many death certificates to order for a deceased loved one, or they may rely on a private health insurance provider to educate them about Medicare.</p>
<p>In other cases, people find out about services and benefits while interacting with the government for other unrelated reasons. One man we spoke to was at the DMV for a routine appointment, and while he was there, he asked about the passport application process.</p>
<p>Only one person interviewed reported that they learned about a new program by browsing a government website.</p>
<h3>Barriers to government services</h3>
<h4>Digital literacy</h4>
<p>Digital literacy exists on a spectrum.</p>
<p>At the high end of the spectrum are people who are technologically savvy. They have few barriers to online services, and the barriers they do face tend to be trust-based — that is, centered around whether an online channel will yield them the best results.</p>
<p>In the middle, you have folks who are familiar with basic online interactions but struggle with complex ones. These people may more frequently opt for offline channels, but could be converted to online channels if those were made easier to use and helped the user feel confident that they will achieve their goals, freeing up offline resources for those who truly need them.</p>
<p>At the low end of the spectrum are people who are unable to tell that the www in a link indicates a web address and the @ indicates an email address. These folks will always need offline channels, such as call centers or physical offices, to access government services. Seniors and people with low income are more likely to fall at this end of the spectrum.</p>
<h4>Digital access</h4>
<p>A correlation exists between digital literacy and digital access. People who are able to afford good internet access at home and own multiple devices are also more likely to be digitally literate. These people have no technical issues connecting to online resources.</p>
<p>Others may have a smartphone but no internet or computer at home. For these folks, responsive web design and intuitive interaction patterns are crucial; otherwise, they will avail themselves of offline channels, which are often more resource intensive for agencies. Often, people in this group rely on public computers (at libraries or senior centers, for instance) where they often cannot get assistance, so it’s especially important that online services be easy to use.</p>
<p>People without access to any devices or the internet are also the least likely to be digitally literate, and vice versa. They may use public resources to go online, but if they do use the internet, they are more likely to do so recreationally. This group is the most likely to seek government services through offline channels such as call centers, mail, or visits to an agency office.</p>
<h4>English proficiency</h4>
<p>English fluency also exists on a scale, and low fluency presents its own barriers to interacting with the government. In general, bilingual speakers find that non-English translations of government sites are inaccurate or incomplete. They complained that when government sites are available in their native languages, those sites are direct translations from English, and as such are unintelligible.</p>
<p>Non-native English speakers who have used English at school and work for years may feel more comfortable speaking English than their native language. They almost always prefer the English version of a government site or service.</p>
<p>People with limited English proficiency often still prefer the English version of a site, even if they struggle with complicated or technical language. Sometimes, they will switch back and forth between the English version of a site and the one in their native language to make sense of &nbsp;content. These folks may be better served by content written in plain language in English if human-created translations are not available. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Those with no English skills depend on friends or family to help them navigate government sites when no translations are available, or they may forgo a government service altogether.</p>
<h4>Complicated Terminology</h4>
<p>Maria K. from Jacksonville described how she struggled with the complicated terminology on an unemployment application but had no problems with the application for food stamps, which used simpler language. &nbsp;“I didn’t feel it was that complicated of language for me to use the Spanish [version],” she said. “I’ve been in the states for 13 years now, so my English is not that bad. The questions for the food stamps were, like, a little easier and more basic type of thing than the unemployment [questions] were.”</p>
<p>Alvaro S. shared how he helped his mother out with a question she had about Social Security. Because she only speaks Spanish and does not regularly use the internet, he looked up her question online, found the answer in Spanish, printed out the web page, and snail mailed it to her across the country.</p>

In a nutshell, transcreation involves taking a concept in one language and completely recreating it in another language. A successfully transcreated message (either written or visual) evokes the same emotions and carries the same implications in the target language as it does in the source language, but in a way that resonates with the target audience.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>What’s the big deal you may wonder? After all, a good translation already re-shapes a text at the cultural and linguistic levels. However, transcreation goes a step further. It requires that the translator become a cultural expert, sensitive to the audience's emotions, needs and cultural backgrounds. Transcreation enhances the translator’s creativity and capacity to tailor the message to the specific target audience. The important question here is how close the transcreated message comes to the target audience's needs.</p>
<p>At GobiernoUSA.gov we create original content, but we also transcreate; two recent pieces of content are good examples of us exercising transcreation.</p>
<p>USA.gov recently published “Bouquets and Bruises: This Valentine’s Day, Help Someone Experiencing Abuse.” Such a delicate topic, not only posed challenges to the writer, but for the Spanish transcreator. The intention of this feature was to raise awareness about physical and emotional violence on a day many people consider to be the most romantic day of the year.</p>
<p>In order to maintain the same emotional responses in the target language, the cultural references to Valentine’s Day, although traditionally not so prevalent in the Hispanic world, were kept in the Spanish version. (Not saying that Hispanics aren’t romantic, we also call it “Friendship day!"") However, the piece in Spanish diverted from the original text when it directly addressed the fear that immigrants have of being deported if they report abuse. The text highlights the resources available to them regardless of their status. Finally, there was a paragraph on college safety which was replaced by community safety. It offered resources to empower individuals that want to speak out when they know of or witness abuse or domestic violence in their workplace or where they live.</p>
<p>The upcoming feature “<strong>Discover Six of the Government's Best Mobile Apps</strong>” posed a different set of challenges. Research shows that the Hispanic community relies on their smartphones to access information and over index on mobile use, so this presented an ideal opportunity to offer these useful government resources. Unfortunately, only a few apps are available in Spanish. After spending a considerable time and effort researching possible counterparts, we decided to include mobile sites that&nbsp;are&nbsp;available in Spanish, and rename the feature “<strong>Descubra lo que el Gobierno le ofrece a trav√©s de su tel√©fono inteligente</strong>” or “Discover what’s available from the Government using your smartphone.” The resources were selected from a bigger pool of options based on the most prevalent interests to the Hispanic community: food safety, consumer protection, and health issues.</p>
<p>In both cases, to avoid losing impact with a mere direct translation, and still resonating with your intended audience, GobiernoUSA.gov purposely transcreated the features and solved the issues of cultural sensibilities and resource availability. This takes time and care, but renders results if you take the time to do it and you have an integrated bilingual and bicultural team that understands the needs of the audiences you’re trying to reach.</p>

<p><em><a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/informing-the-future-of-the-federal-front-door"">In our previous post</a>, we detailed our initial research questions and what we learned. Today, we’re sharing the strategies people use when interacting with the government. Later this week, we’ll detail how people navigate government services and what we learned about people’s views on transparency.</em></p>
<h3>Interaction strategies and attitudes toward government</h3>
<p>People have varied attitudes toward different agencies, and they employ varied strategies to interact with them. Sometimes people believe an agency is working for them, while other times they believe it’s working against them.</p>
<h4>Information-seeking strategies</h4>
<p>People employ various tactics to learn more about government systems. We observed that people either actively seek out information or passively receive it.</p>
<p>People sometimes actively seek information from agencies by searching websites, calling agencies, and otherwise directly asking for help. Those who actively seek out information can usually find what they need by navigating government websites or contacting call centers. Alvaro S. in Minneapolis, for example, described how he found out about a home rehabilitation loan program by exploring the links on his city’s website. He called the city to see if he was qualified, and after finding out he was, promptly submitted his application. He received the loan and was able to make improvements on his house.</p>
<p>Other times, people passively receive information — in the form of advice from friends, for example, or instructions given to them directly. For example, many folks we spoke to have seen signs for TSA PreCheck at the airport, yet didn’t know what it was or how to get it and haven’t researched it further.</p>
<p>Instead of acting on the belief that all customers will research programs or services they’re unfamiliar with, agencies might instead explore ways to “push” information to those people through social media, text messages, direct mail, or other means.</p>
<h4>Beliefs about the government</h4>
<p>People who already believe an agency is working for them don’t need to be convinced that the government will follow through on its promises. They mainly want an efficient transaction. To reach these people, an agency should focus on ways of making interactions and processes as smooth as possible.</p>
<p>Alternatively, those who believe an agency is working against them will require more trust-building efforts. To reach this group, an agency should focus on transparency —&nbsp;for example, explaining why they need certain pieces of information, how long a process might take, and whom a person can contact if they have questions or concerns.</p>
<p>The federal government currently does a better job of serving people who actively seek information and who trust that the government is working for them. To improve its reach, it should consider finding ways to serve people with other attitudes and information-seeking strategies.</p>
<h4>Information Seeking Style</h4>
<p>A person’s information-seeking style can have a major impact on services they access, benefits they receive, and the outcome of certain life events. One woman in Minneapolis — a passive information seeker —&nbsp;purchased her home at the first viewing based solely on her friend’s recommendation. Her friend also happened to be the realtor for that house. To finance this purchase, the woman took out an FHA loan (without first researching other lenders) because her friend encouraged her to. Though the woman was satisfied with her purchase, she may have missed out on a better mortgage rate because of her decision to skip doing research.</p>
<p>Aisha R., a childcare provider &nbsp;in Kansas City, complained about not having health insurance, though she hadn’t checked out any of the health exchanges because she assumed they were all too expensive. Her friends told her that she’d likely have problems signing up, so she decided not to bother.</p>
<p>In both scenarios, it is unclear whether the people we talked to would have found better options had they actively sought information. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Today, we’ll talk about how we chose USAGov.</em></p>
<!--more--><p>It was clear that our previous name, the Federal Citizen Information Center (FCIC), had a few issues.</p>
<p>Most pressing: The majority of people we interviewed and polled hadn’t heard of our organization, so our brand recognition was low. And many of those who had heard of FCIC knew us by one of our various channels — USA.gov, GobiernoUSA.gov, Kids.gov, Publications.USA.gov, or 1-844-USA-GOV1. So they didn’t necessarily realize the full scope of our offerings or know that all these channels were tied together under one organization.</p>
<p>At the same time, the names of those channels had underlying strengths. Our focus groups emphasized that the “gov” suffix carried trustworthy, official, and knowledgeable connotations. And we knew that a name linking “USA” and “gov” quickly conveyed “U.S. government.”</p>
<p>Although they provided a strong foundation, the names of those channels fell short of being viable options for a parent brand. The name “USA.gov,” for example, is specific to one website. As a parent brand, it wouldn’t represent all of our channels. And moving forward, as we continue to grow and evolve, it would keep our brand tied to one technology.</p>
<p>So the idea arose: Let’s drop the dot.</p>
<p>The name “USAGov” retains the positive connotations of the “gov” suffix. It quickly conveys “U.S. government.” And it is not channel-specific. It is, we believe, a strong parent brand — and the perfect thread to weave throughout our channels, much like ESPN is the parent brand for ESPN.com, ESPN The Magazine, ESPN Deportes, and additional sub-brands.</p>
<p>In September, we made it official. USAGov replaced the FCIC name, both internally and externally. We created a new logo. We created new brand design templates for use in daily activities by USAGov team members. And we created <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdlVbBllr9I"">a video</a> to tell the story of USAGov to both external and internal audiences along with a n<a href=""http://usa.gov/explore"">ew online exploratory landing page</a>.</p>
<p>Just as it was important to convey to the public that USAGov offers a wide range of channels and resources, it was important — internally — to convey to employees that we are all one team. There are no silos. The website teams, the contact center team, and the publications team are all united under the same parent brand and the same mission. Together as USAGov, we’re delivering government information and services to the public.</p>

USAGov Blog,Informing the Future of the Federal Front Door,Informing the Future of the Federal Front Door,en,/blog/2016/03/informing-the-future-of-the-federal-front-door,dcward,User Experience and Accessibility,Informing the Future of the Federal Front Door,2016-03-01 00:00:00,2018-10-11T16:20:08.794Z,"<p>In our <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/learning-how-to-build-a-better-front-door-for-the-federal-government"">last post</a>, we introduced the Federal Front Door project and briefly described a six-week discovery phase, in which we set out to better understand how the general public feels about and interacts with the federal government, so that we can design and build products that improve people’s experience across government agencies.</p>
<!--more--><p>We think of the federal front door as the places the public first interacts with their government. There are many front doors—agency websites (like <a href=""http://www.benefits.gov/"">benefits.gov</a>), physical places (like Social Security offices), contact centers (like 1-844-USA-GOV1)—where people start interacting with the government.</p>
<p>Today, we’re publishing <a href=""https://labs.usa.gov/#research-report"">a full report</a> with findings from our research, as well as a <a href=""https://labs.usa.gov/"">microsite</a> which will contain future research findings related to these topics. In the coming days, we’ll also be publishing the complete report on the 18F blog.</p>
<h3>What we did</h3>
<p>We conducted 35 interviews of roughly 45 minutes and 29 short intercept interviews in Jacksonville, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and Sacramento. We also collected 52 diary entries from seven diary study participants.</p>
<h3>What we learned</h3>
<p>We found:</p>
<ul>
 <li>People depend on others for help (proxies), but services are not set up to support this</li>
 <li>The government is a black box</li>
 <li>Choice overload is a problem</li>
 <li>People trust the government to varying degrees, based on the context of their interaction</li>
 <li>People make a cost-benefit assessment before interacting with government</li>
 <li>Agencies may be able to share users’ information under certain circumstances</li>
</ul>
<p>We discovered three distinct barriers that prevent the public from having a pleasant interaction with the government:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Capacity—Lack of public servants to handle the number of people interacting with federal agencies.</li>
 <li>Digital Infrastructure—Systems do not cross agency barriers and assist the public with getting through forms and process.</li>
 <li>Volume of people seeking government information or services—The sheer number of people attempting to interact with the government on the daily basis causes many bottlenecks and issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>This post provides an overview of these findings. Additional information and findings is published (pdf) and will be published in a series on our blog over the next two weeks.</p>
<h3>Proxies</h3>
<p>People rely on friends and family for help and guidance during major life events or through difficult processes. People most likely to rely on others include seniors, non-native English speakers, and people with a disability.</p>
<p>When someone experiences a major life change, their friends and family will offer them advice on what to do, including on what government benefits they should apply for.</p>
<p>This relationship extends to getting help with difficult government interactions. For example, someone may help their Spanish-speaking parents file their taxes every year.</p>
<p>When social networks break down for people, they are more likely to slip through the cracks. Many low-income seniors or seniors with disabilities have no social networks, and as such have no one to help them access online government services.</p>
<p>People will also ask librarians, senior center staff, and other agency staff to help with online applications, but in many cases those ‘helpers’ are forbidden to help these people by their employer’s policy.</p>
<p>When government officials refuse to talk to a proxy about a person’s case, that person is often stymied in their efforts to access government services.</p>
<h3>Black box of government</h3>
<p>The general public wants to be able to “see” the process when interacting with federal agencies and programs. This includes knowing when their information has been received, reviewed, and overall clarity into why the process takes as long as it does. People expect to wait, but the reasons why and the causes for delay continue to be a mystery.</p>
<p>When people know how their information is going to be used and why it’s needed, they are more comfortable providing personal information to the federal government. In addition, if eligibility requirements were clearly explained, people would be better prepared and only apply for programs that fit their need.</p>
<p>When people interact with the federal government, typically there is a lot of pressure on their shoulders. The source of this pressure could be the life event that is triggering the interaction. The pressure also comes from the idea that people only get one shot to get their paperwork right, that there are negative consequences for doing something wrong, and their request is being treated as a potentially fraudulent rather than coming from a place of real need.</p>
<h3>Choice overload</h3>
<p>Sometimes, the government gives people:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Choices that have so many options, it’s hard to know which is the best to pick (e.g. picking a Medicare Part C plan).</li>
 <li>Choices where it’s hard to figure out the consequences of picking a particular option (e.g. choosing an age at which to start drawing on Social Security).</li>
</ul>
<p>People like having choices; they just struggle to make the best choice in these situations. They want to know which choices align with their goals and understand the trade-offs between them.</p>
<h3>Trust</h3>
<p>Trust is a two way street and includes both the public trusting the government and the government trusting the public.</p>
<p>We should assume real need and positive intent when designing services. Many people felt like interactions with government employees and agencies, as well as digital services, assume they have negative intentions or they are lying, lazy, or a criminal.</p>
<p>People employ a variety of strategies before deciding to trust a government digital service. They look for https, .gov, official logos, and/or specific language like “this is an official government website.” Others do not differentiate between government services and private companies or think government websites cannot be spoofed and fall victim to scams. We need to consider how we can help people spot official websites and services.</p>
<h3>Cost-benefit tradeoff</h3>
<p>Before using a government service or applying for benefits, people assess the return on investment. They want to know if the time and effort spent interacting with the government will be worth the benefit. We can do more to lower the initial investment.</p>
<p>If you are less confident you will get the service you need, you are less likely to apply for those services. Some people are easily discouraged and give up after one attempt, while others are resilient and willing to persevere. This can be based on past experiences with the government or lack of confidence in their ability to deal with government bureaucracy.</p>
<p>People are frustrated when the same information is asked multiple times across agencies, from within the same agency, and across levels of government. This increases the cost of interacting with the government.</p>
<p>These factors can lead some people to interact with the government through private companies, like enrolling in Medicare through Kaiser, or through professionals, like lawyers or funeral homes. Some of these relationships with private companies are more official and sanctioned, while others seem to be filling in the gaps.</p>
<h3>Sharing information</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, people understand that to interact with the federal government it will require them to provide certain key pieces of information to help identify themselves, and additional information that is required for the specific interaction. How people feel about providing that information, and how it might be used both for their current interaction and potential future ones is a bit of a mixed bag.</p>
<h3>Access to personal information</h3>
<p>People see the value of sharing their information, however members of the public would like to opt-in to sharing their information across the government, manage requests for their information, see who is accessing their information, and understand that their information is secure and not being shared outside of the federal government.</p>
<h3>What’s next?</h3>
<p>GSA has identified several opportunities to improve the public’s interactions and increase the efficacy and efficiency of service delivery. We are beginning to explore multiple projects which include ways to:</p>
<h4>Broaden the draft U.S. Web Design Standards to include best practices for transparent service design, trust, and accessibility.</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Include guidance on forms, communicating application status, explaining processes and other ways to open the “black box” of government. This effort will improve the quality of online service delivery, freeing up capacity on more-expensive channels like call centers for those who truly need them.</li>
 <li>Create guidance on multiple methods to create and reinforce user trust in government systems.</li>
 <li>Suggest design patterns for simplifying and clarifying the consequences of important choices.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Identify and streamline cross-agency services</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Identify one or more cross-agency services that will serve as good pilot (those that cause the most confusion due to “the black box of government) programs for experimentation with streamlined service delivery and possible shared services.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Explore innovative means of information dissemination</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Work with search engines and other private-sector “front doors” to the government to ensure they are surfacing official information and sites when users would find it useful</li>
 <li>Develop materials and design services for trusted advisors and proxies who are often in positions to help users in need</li>
</ul>
<h4>Foster secure, private information sharing between agencies</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Define standard schema and APIs to allow seamless sharing of personal information from one agency to another when authorized -- and to limit it to only the information that is necessary</li>
 <li>Develop tools to act as middleware between agencies -- so we can develop this once instead of every time two agencies need to share information</li>
 <li>Create or improve existing eligibility-checking tools</li>

<!--more--><p>At USAGov, we know that email is often our #1 driver of traffic to our content, and nine out of 10 times it’s our go-to outreach tool for disseminating timely information. But doing email sends consistently and effectively isn’t always clear cut, especially when you have a combined 1.3 million subscribers.</p>
<p>We send email blasts to our subscriber lists about all sorts of content based on what they signed up to get. Topics range from immigration to travel, health, and jobs.</p>
<h3>We primarily use email to:</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Support a marketing campaign</li>
 <li>Drive traffic to timely content on our websites</li>
 <li>Promote social media chats or events</li>
 <li>Amplify information or alerts on behalf of other government agencies</li>
</ul>
<p>With every email, a lot of consideration goes into the draft, quality and purpose of why we’re sending a particular communication.</p>
<p>Before we draft the email and hit send, we ensure that the message is:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Timely and useful</li>
 <li>Mobile, tablet, and desktop friendly.</li>
 <li>In plain language, clear, and action-oriented.</li>
 <li>Reaching the right audience - In the future, we would like to explore segmentation and targeting (geo-specific when appropriate, for example when we do disaster communications).</li>
</ul>
<p>The email team also monitors and stays up to date on consumer trends and promotes content on our sites that might be of interest to the public.</p>
<h3>What email has done for us:</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Contributed to major traffic spikes on our web pages.</li>
 <li>Spiked calls to our call center. For example, an email we sent about tax identity theft&nbsp;triggered a high number of calls.</li>
 <li>Informed the public about a campaign and increased public participation in social media chats.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Experimentation and Measurement</h3>
<p>We evaluate every message we send by reviewing our data about a week after an email’s sent. Unique open rates and click rates—both numbers and percentages—help us evaluate what content performed well. We know, for example, that we have a lot of visitors to USA.gov and GobiernoUSA.gov seeking information on immigration. We align that information with our email sends, and the open rates and click-through rates prove the value of knowing what people are interested in.</p>
<p>At the end of every month, our internal performance measurement team provides us with a detailed report of how our messages performed. This is valuable information that informs and influences our email content strategy. We combine the data from email behavior with data from website visits and <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/phone"">calls to our contact center</a>, 1-844-USA-GOV1. All of these factors determine what we invest time writing about.</p>
<p>Many factors go into a successful email, from subject line, to preheader text, to bypassing spam filtering systems. After you checked all these off, you also need to consider images.</p>
<p>We’ve noted that eight out of 10 times emails with images outperform emails that don’t include images. An image should always support your content and should include <a href=""http://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/"">alternative text</a> for screen readers.</p>
<h3>Things to Consider</h3>
<p>There are numerous things to take into consideration as you explore email sends and campaigns. Here are some key questions to explore for your strategy:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Are your email marketing writers familiar with your content strategy? Do they understand your organization’s voice?</li>
 <li>Will you have dedicated resources to employ a consistent communications output?</li>
 <li>Will you be able to ensure quality control so messages are well-written, timely, culturally relevant, and targeted?</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay tuned for a series of posts on email content and strategy.</p>

Facebook's megaphone is a featured box that is displayed at the top of all user's News Feeds. (You may recall seeing these after certain disasters giving users the option to quickly donate to Red Cross or other organizations).</p>
<!--more--><p>We piloted the voter registration megaphone in South Carolina on January 15.</p>
<ul>
 <li>The megaphone was up for 24 hours.</li>
 <li>It generated about 25K visitors.</li>
 <li>About 75 percent of those people either downloaded a registration form to fill out or went directly to their state's website to register.</li>
</ul>
<p>On January 25, the megaphone rolled out in Texas, Georgia, Arkansas and Tennessee. We're still working on collecting all the data from this roll out, but here's some preliminary information.</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href=""http://vote.usa.gov"">Vote.USA.gov</a> climbed to the #2 spot on the <a href=""http://analytics.usa.gov"">analytics.usa.gov</a> dashboard of most viewed government websites.</li>
 <li>Facebook sent about 250K people to the site.</li>
 <li>About 120K people either downloaded a registration form or went directly to their state's website to register.</li>
</ul>
<p>We noticed that the conversion rate was lower in the second set of states, and we're still digging into that data to see if we can figure out why.</p>
<p>This partnership is just one part of our year-long campaign,&nbsp;known as #VoteUSA, to help Americans actively take part in our democracy through voting.

Original scripting, curating through our various publishing channels, and promoting become the lifecycle of every video that we create.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The topics of our videos range from health and archaeology to STEM fields. Over the course of the year, you can find the Kids.gov team at NASA, a wildlife refuge, a nutritionist’s kitchen, or even interviewing a White House chef. All of our videos aim to inspire kids to learn more about government careers and helps teachers with lesson planning.</p>
<p>After shooting and editing these career videos in partnership with other federal government agencies, they’re made available to the general public. But before they are, and in an aim to make these videos as widely available as possible, the team also makes sure that they’re 508 compliant.</p>
<h3>What 508 compliance for video means</h3>
<p>Our videos are hosted on our website, and we normally send our audience to the site to watch them instead of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/kidsgov"">our YouTube channel</a> and TeacherTube, but because YouTube is not fully accessible, we also host them on our website. When we promote the videos on social media and through emails, we normally send our audience directly to the site to watch them.</p>
<p>In order to meet accessibility standards, each of our videos include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Closed captioning and a transcript</li>
<li>Audio descriptions of action or visuals</li>
<li>An mp3 downloadable version and an accessible downloadable player</li>
</ul>
<p>We know that creating accessible versions of our videos makes a big difference and is extremely important to the people we serve based on some of the feedback they've shared with us -- like this note we received this week from Karen Wolffee, a Ph.D. from Salus University.</p>
<p>""I appreciate your help - the accessible videos are a great help to the students with whom we are working - youth who are blind or have low vision. I shall make the young adults with whom I work aware of the videos and appreciate you sending me the link - that will make it easier for them.""</p>

The goal of the research is to gain a better understanding of how we can build a better ""front door"" to the federal government by building new digital services and enhancing existing ones.</p>
<!--more--><p>Over the next few months, we'll share what we're doing and learning with a series of blog posts.</p>
<h3>What is this project and why are you doing it?</h3>
<p>When we started this project we knew that, for many people, interacting with the government is a mixed bag of emotions, some good and some bad. Right now, a lot of the information and services available from government sites are organized according to the agency that provides them, but that doesn’t always meet the needs of the people accessing that information or those services. Since the methods people use to interact with the government are so diverse, we didn’t really know when and how people connected with the government, or how they experienced those interactions. We also weren’t sure how people’s attitudes towards the government affected those interactions.</p>
<p>So we started this project with a six-week discovery phase of interviews in five major, diverse cities across the U.S. to answer those questions. This will help us shape the next phase of the project, in which we’ll design experiments based on what we learned to further explore how we can improve services and information across the government. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>So, what is the ""federal front door""?</h3>
<p>We think of the federal front door as the places the public first interacts with their government. There are many front doors — agency websites (like <a href=""http://benefits.gov"">benefits.gov</a>), physical places (like Social Security offices), contact centers (like 1-844-USA-GOV1) — where people start interacting with the government.</p>
<h3>With so many ""front doors"" to the federal government already, what does this project hope to do?</h3>
<p>This project won't necessarily build new front doors; it's about learning ways to improve our existing ones. We won't be rolling out lots of new websites for interacting with the government, but instead we’ll be figuring out ways we can simplify, streamline, and improve people’s interactions with the current ones (especially ones that interact with multiple agencies).</p>
<h3>What's next?</h3>
<p>As we wind down our research, you can expect to hear more about how we conducted it and what we found. You can expect us to build little experiments to test our ideas, test them out with users, and continuously iterate. And we'll be sharing the process through blog posts, and other media. In a future post, we’ll talk about how we went about doing research without a particular product or website in mind. Stay tuned.</p>

The federal office was located inside the U.S. courthouse and the metal detectors had not yet arrived in the aftermath of the attempted assassination of President Ford.</p>
<!--more--><p>Snaider, nervous on the inside, calmly looked at the man and asked him about the handcuff emblem on his tie-pin. A security guard heard the exchange and asked for verification that the visitor was indeed a law enforcement officer. He was. Fortunately for the GSA, Snaider did not let that incident and many others stop him from serving the government for 40 plus years.</p>
<p>Today, Snaider carries the informal title of Information Specialist with GSA’s USAGov in Washington, D.C. He no longer deals directly with the public but focuses on quality assurance for the contact center.</p>
<p>Over the years, Snaider has witnessed many evolutionary changes at USAGov but two stand out. The technology innovations were the first. Today’s computers are networked - a far cry from the original automation of the Federal Information Centers that required manually carrying disks from computer to computer.</p>
<p>The other transformation was the various channels people can use to reach out to the government. It went from walk-ins and phone calls with small centers in over 40 federal buildings nationwide to a single contact center with the ability to handle public inquiries about the government via&nbsp; e-mail, phone, postal mail and chat.</p>
<p>“If you have a question at 10:30 at night, you …..write an email, send it off to us and we will get back to you in a few hours on the next business day. It is a great opportunity to serve people,”&nbsp;Snaider said.</p>
<p>Another way Snaider’s tenure mirrors&nbsp;USAGov's growth was when he was hired in 1972 - &nbsp;he had a basic understanding of Spanish. Even then, the government understood the importance of being bilingual. Today, the contact center responds in all channels in both English and Spanish.</p>
<p>Snaider also played a vital role in formalizing the establishment of GSA’s network of contact centers in 1978, as one of a handful staffers who gave testimony before a Congressional hearing in San Francisco as part of the legislation process that led to the signing of Public Law 95-491, the Federal Information Centers Act.</p>
<p>After seven years in his native California, Snaider got a chance to move to GSA’s main office in Washington, D.C. &nbsp;when a colleague declined a position at headquarters. He went from seeing the public daily to being a bureaucrat in two weeks. In the beginning, it was not easy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“At first, I really missed my family. I lived like a king in Sacramento but even with the promotion, D.C. was expensive. And I missed interacting with the public, but my boss told me, 'You have an administrative role now.' It was great advice, and I adjusted to helping in a new role,” he recalled.</p>
<p>Helping people is part of Snaider’s DNA. He &nbsp;grew up a military ""brat,"" the son of an Air Force officer with a brother who is a Naval Academy graduate. Snaider himself was drafted into the Army after graduating from Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif.</p>
<p>As part of his love of serving others, “Did I answer your question?” became his signature phrase on the phone and in writing.</p>
<p>Both personal and professional changes plus surviving two bouts of cancer tell him it is time for a new transition. He will miss coming to work, seeing his colleagues and helping the contact center deal with complicated inquiries. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Although he was born in Berkeley, Calif., and has lived in Nagoya, Japan; Laredo, Texas; Montgomery, Alabama; Minot, North Dakota; the city of Washington, and other places, the city of Mountain View, south of San Francisco,in Silicon Valley, is the place Snaider calls home. He plans to move back to the west coast after selling his condo in D.C. Then he will focus on his hobbies - gardening and running.</p>
<p>As a new chapter begins for Snaider, his love of learning, historic government knowledge and cheerful attitude will be missed by the entire USAGov family. &nbsp;</p>

Insight into your audience’s motivations, behavior and preferences is key for anyone trying to engage with the public. &nbsp;</p>
<!--more--><p>We know every day that more and more Hispanics are on social media, but on which platforms?, Where are they participating? And more importantly, &nbsp;in what language?</p>
<p>No issue is more debated than <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/real-internationalization-isnt-just-geographic-its-linguistic"">the role “Spanglish” plays</a> in the way organizations communicate with the Latino community in the United States. So last Wednesday, USAGov in collaboration with DigitalGov University, hosted an interactive event exploring the critical role social media plays in reaching Hispanics in this country.</p>
<p>Here are the top 5 takeaways from the event:</p>
<ol>
 <li><strong>There’s no one-size fits all approach to reaching Hispanics on social media.</strong> Some agencies find it works best to communicate from accounts strictly in Spanish. Others, like Peace Corps and USAGov are using different languages from different accounts. And other organizations like Voto Latino communicate mainly in English.</li>
 <li><strong>Cultural relevance is crucial in messages.</strong> Some messages that might play well with a primarily English-dominant audience might not resonate with a more bilingual or even Spanish-dominant audience. When communicating about topics like voting and elections, access to healthcare or emergency response, it’s important to speak the language that your audience speaks -- whether that’s English, Spanish or something in between.</li>
 <li><strong>Tailor your communications strategy to reach specific audiences (or generations) within the Hispanic community.</strong> New research from the <a href=""http://www.hispanicmillennialproject.com/"">Hispanic Millennial Project</a> shows that Hispanic Millennials are less likely to indicate that they will need a mortgage, strive to have good credit despite being in debt, prefer Facebook and stream over three hours of music every day. <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_S79lXdhuh0VHc0Q29IY3JCRG8/view?pli=1"">Check out the rest of the research findings that Sensis shared</a>.</li>
 <li><strong>The demands of our audiences are changing, but we’re poised to meet them. </strong>With limited staff and resources, it can sometimes seem like engaging new audiences is an impossible task. But several agencies demonstrated ways to take small steps toward that goal. It can be as simple as hosting a Twitter chat or answering questions in the language they are asked. Agencies are innovating around how to use their limited resources to maximize their reach. <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_S79lXdhuh0VHc0Q29IY3JCRG8/view?pli=1"">Check out great examples from the CDC, FEMA and the SBA in the slides from our presenters</a>.</li>
 <li><strong>There’s a need for us to work together more on this!</strong> We plan to continue the conversation, both online using the hashtag #SomosSocial, and through more trainings, webinars and future discussions.

<!--more-->
<p>Over the past year, USAGov has reinvented itself as the federal front door of the government &nbsp;-- through a new, adaptive publishing system, an integrated digital and live-agent experience, responsive and accessible websites, print publications dedicated to helping the public protect themselves from scams and fraud, and more.</p>
<p>USAGov provides government information and services to millions of citizens every year. &nbsp;But that’s not enough. &nbsp;We know that most people are frustrated by the disconnects in government</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do they need to keep information updated with multiple agencies? &nbsp;</li>
<li>Why can’t they complete their tasks more seamlessly -- whether those tasks fall into the domain of the city, state, or federal government? &nbsp;</li>
<li>Why is it almost impossible to get a single, straightforward, and friendly answer consistently as they engage with multiple agencies? &nbsp;</li>
<li>And why is it so difficult to track the status of their requested services?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the questions at the top of our minds as we continue to bring together agencies across government into a single, trusted source -- USAGov. &nbsp;We’re committed to making life easier for citizens and bringing government into the sunlight. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next year, we’re exploring ways to work with states and cities through the Open311 common infrastructure, so that citizens can request services from all levels of government through a simple, common system. &nbsp;We’re also working with our friends at Data.gov to develop the first-ever machine readable government org chart. &nbsp;We’re participating in important cross-government efforts to increase broadband adoption&nbsp;and promote <a href=""http://sites.ed.gov/hispanic-initiative/"">educational initiatives for Hispanics</a>. &nbsp;And we’re tapping into the talent at GSA’s <a href=""https://18f.gsa.gov/"">18F</a> and <a href=""https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/"">Presidential Innovation Fellows</a> program to continuously roll out <a href=""https://blog.usa.gov/usa-gov-launches-vote-usa-gov-to-help-citizens-register-to-vote"">new functionality and services on USA.gov</a>. &nbsp;We look forward to working with our partner agencies and citizens to improve the public’s experience with government.</p>

USAGov Blog,Are Videos in Spanish the Way To Go?,Are Videos in Spanish the Way To Go?,en,/blog/2015/10/are-videos-in-spanish-the-way-to-go,dcward,Multilingual,Are Videos in Spanish the Way To Go?,2015-10-28 00:00:00,2023-06-15T15:04:51.071Z,"<p>The answer may surprise you. It takes time, resources and actual money. Why prepare a video for something that can be written about and released in a shorter time&nbsp;span at a much lower cost? This question is now the new normal. But are we asking the right question?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to a Nielsen&nbsp;report, the average Hispanic spends more than eight hours viewing online videos every month. That is 1.5 hours more than the U.S. average. Despite having a smaller audience, the engagement on Spanish videos is greater than that of its counterparts. Spanish video content simply seems to “stick” better.</p>
<p>This is something we’ve seen firsthand at USA.gov. Across all social media, GobiernoUSA.gov’s audience is smaller than that of its sister site USA.gov. The English channels are larger on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Yet, when it comes to video viewership,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/GobiernoUSA"">GobiernoUSA.gov’s YouTube channel</a>&nbsp;is much higher despite having less subscribers.</p>
<p>In fact from August 2014 to August 2015, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/USGovernment"">USA.gov’s YouTube channel&nbsp;</a>has gotten over 45,000 views with an estimated 59,000 minutes watched. On the other hand, GobiernoUSA.gov’s YouTube channel received more than 221,000 views with over 375,000 minutes watched during the same period. Even though GobiernoUSA.gov published one new video and streamed one event compared to USA.gov’s five videos and two streamed events, the content in Spanish went much farther. The hungry audience for Spanish-language video material can't be ignored.</p>
<p>We can see it in the corporate world, as more and more retailers are creating Spanish video content that goes beyond a 30-second ad during a commercial break. YouTube channels play a bigger role than ever, as viewership moves from the TV to the computer. The next years could show a shift to video content as creators realize that this could be the key for the Spanish markets. We could be on the verge of seeing a shift to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vertical video content—if everyone watches videos on their phones or tablets, why not?</li>
<li>Integrated messages on a single platform—get everything by clicking on a video.</li>
<li>Cross-brand Hispanic targeted campaigns, with some serious punditry. (ie. phone and insurance companies)</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Final Thought</h3>
<p>In most cases, the content in English is the bread and butter of a platform and Spanish takes a second seat since it serves a smaller audience. But statistics show that even if the raw numbers are lower, Hispanics place more importance and time on video resources, giving content in Spanish a higher penetration rate. This is not to discourage English video content, but encourage you to give serious thought to incorporating video content in Spanish related to your mission. Even Netflix has rolled out two productions for Spanish audiences this year. The trend suggests we could be headed to the&nbsp;golden age of video content in Spanish, and we cannot afford to be caught off guard.</p>

They are an important tool to share customer insights and understanding across an organization. Personas also serve as a check to make sure your organization’s actions meet the needs of the majority of customers, including visitors to your website, contact center, in-person visits, and interactive voice response (IVR) self service customers.</p>
<!--more-->
<h3>Why We Updated our Personas</h3>
<p>Personas aren’t new to USA.gov. We developed personas several years ago because we recognized the importance of understanding our customers, their behaviors and information needs. As we’re evolving USA.gov and our contact center platforms, updated personas are important.</p>
<p>We created <a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/digitalgov/_legacy-img/2015/04/USA.gov-Personas-March-2015.pdf"">new personas</a> [PDF] of the customers who currently use USA.gov and 1-844-USA-GOV1 based on the themes and insights observed from several different data sets. We reviewed the following 2014 data:</p>
<ul>
<li>USA.gov Web analytics (via the Digital Analytics Program), including demographics, devices, common paths, popular pages, and outbound links</li>
<li>Onsite search data from DigitalGov Search</li>
<li>USA.gov customer satisfaction survey data</li>
<li>Searches on Google that led customers to USA.gov (via Google Webmaster Tools)</li>
<li>1-844-USA-GOV1 contact center content usage</li>
<li>Web analytics for other government websites available through the Digital Analytics Program</li>
<li>General search trends on Google</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Learned</h3>
<p>Our customers are diverse and come to USA.gov with a range of goals and to find a broad scope of information and services. We categorized them by type of information seeking behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete a transaction (or find information to prepare to complete a transaction)</li>
<li>Find specific information on a known topic</li>
<li>Browse information or learn more on a general topic</li>
<li>Find contact information for an agency or elected official</li>
</ul>
<p>These categories aren’t perfect – there is overlap between the customer types. A customer may fall into multiple types, but we still think these personas are useful for thinking about how our customers look for information.</p>
<h4>Complete a transaction (or find information to prepare to complete a transaction)</h4>
<p>Many customers come to us to complete a transaction, such as renewing a passport or to change their address.</p>
<p>Many government transactions involve downloading forms or finding copies of a vital document, such as a birth certificate. Due to the preparation involved in completing some transactions, we know customers come to us for help with this step.</p>
<h4>Find specific information on a known topic</h4>
<p>These customers know what they want but need help finding it. They might want to know how to get a free copy of their credit report or how to apply for Social Security benefits. We occasionally get inquiries that are very specific, such as the number of people on welfare in Kansas in 2011.</p>
<h4>Browse information or learn more on a general topic</h4>
<p>We know from survey comments that many customers want to browse information on a topic. They want to see all available health insurance options, for example.</p>
<p>More frequently, they may have an idea in mind about what information they want, but they do not know exactly what that information is. A popular example is financial assistance available from the government. Many customers want to know what assistance is available to them, but can’t articulate if they want a grant, loan, etc.</p>
<h4>Find contact information for an agency or elected official</h4>
<p>This also falls under finding specific information on a known topic, but the A-Z directory of federal agencies is so popular, it’s worth making a separate category. Customers are looking for contact information, especially hard to find information, such as the phone number for the IRS.</p>
<h3>Steps in Developing USA.gov Personas</h3>
<p>We drafted our personas in about two weeks and kept our process simple. We involved key stakeholders, such as managers, from the beginning. We also used data from multiple sources to inform our personas. To create personas for each type of customer, we picked some of the most common tasks people come to us to accomplish. We even had a little fun with data. After choosing an age in the most popular age range, we used the <a href=""http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/"">Social Security Administration’s baby name data</a> to pick the most popular name for that year.</p>
<p>While the personas are composite representations, the quotes associated with them are from real customers. Because of time and resource constraints, we used customer satisfaction survey comments as the main source of qualitative data.</p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>We’re sharing the personas across our organization and creating journey maps based on these personas and the common questions/scenarios they experience. The personas may evolve as we journey map, and we plan to revisit them annually to make sure we’re in step with customer motivations, emotions, goals, needs and behaviors. In the future, we plan to conduct first-person research with current and potential customers of USA.gov to inform our customer understanding and their associated journeys.</p>
<p>We will continue our persona development process to include <a href=""http://www.usa.gov/gobiernousa/"">GobiernoUSA.gov</a> and future customers. This will ensure that we understand and meet ever changing needs. <a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/digitalgov/_legacy-img/2015/04/USA.gov-Personas-March-2015.pdf"">The complete list of our four personas is available</a> [PDF].</p>
<p>In a future post, we will share examples of the customer journey maps associated with our personas.</p>

<!--more--><p>In the last six months of 2014,&nbsp;<a href=""http://marketingland.com/tumblr-pinterest-outgrowing-facebook-109259"">Pinterest increased its membership by 57%</a>, while Facebook and Twitter only grew by 6% and 18%, respectively.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.prweek.com/article/1314174/millennial-moms-need-break-social-media-current-study"">More than 60% of millennial moms use Pinterest</a>, making it a platform perfect for agencies looking to communicate topics related to children and women’s health. And perhaps contrary to popular belief, it goes beyond a female audience. <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/13/men-are-now-pinterests-fastest-growing-demographic/"">Experts say that more men are on Pinterest than read GQ and Sports Illustrated</a>.</p>
<h3>Kids.gov on Pinterest</h3>
<p>Kids.gov is the front door for government information to teachers, parents and kids alike. We launched a <a href=""https://www.pinterest.com/kidsgov/"">Pinterest account for Kids.gov in 2013</a>, but because of limited resources, we weren’t able to be as active and engaged on the platform as we would have liked to be. We know the Kids.gov target audience (parents and teachers) is very active on Pinterest, so about a month ago, we decided to take another look at our strategy. And now, we’re engaging on this platform in a more structured and strategic way.</p>
<p>We’ve focused our Kids.gov Pinterest account on sharing some of the best resources from across government on education, health and activities for children. We’re focusing on sharing a mix of original content, while re-pinning great content from other agencies.</p>
<h3>Landscape</h3>
<p>While most government agencies are not as active as the private sector on Pinterest, the&nbsp;National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are leading the way. NASA also has a large presence on Pinterest, with separate missions or locations having their own accounts.</p>
<p>Health information performs well on Pinterest. For example, the Kids.gov account reshared an <a href=""https://www.pinterest.com/pin/390968811373868361/"">infographic from the CDC</a>, which is still the best performing post we have had. This content performed especially well with the Kids.gov audience, with over 2,000 impressions and 26 repins in the last 30 days alone. We will continue to share great content like this from our partner agencies.</p>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
 <li>As with any social media platform strategy, we’ve set some basic goals to help us measure our success on Pinterest. Our main goal is to increase engagement and the reach of our content by:</li>
 <li>Engaging with other agencies and partners, such as the CDC, NIH, PBS, PTAs, libraries and after-care providers, to name a few.</li>
 <li>Posting numerous times per day, focusing on the early afternoon and around 9 pm, when activity spikes. We post at least 5 times per day, including a quote-of-the-day pin and a crafty science experiment on Mondays.</li>
 <li>Targeting our content specifically to parents during the summer. As the summer ends, we will tweak content towards teachers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check back later this year, as we reveal the results of our Pinterest experiment!</p>

USAGov Blog,Journey Mapping Our Customer Experience,Journey Mapping Our Customer Experience,en,/blog/2015/10/journey-mapping-our-customer-experience,dcward,User Experience and Accessibility,Journey Mapping Our Customer Experience,2015-10-02 23:00:00,2023-04-18T13:48:01.691Z,"<p>Journey maps are a visual representation of a customer’s end to end journey with your product or service. They are a powerful tool for exploring key interactions and experiences with your organization, programs, and/or services.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Journey maps describe a customer’s entire journey, even the parts that occur before and after contact with your organization. They typically contain elements such as the customer’s attitudes, emotions, and needs.</p>
<p>We recently updated USA.gov’s personas and used them as the backbone for our journey maps. We updated our personas to help inform our Web design, content, and contact center services.</p>
<p>We have a lot of data that we regularly analyze, and it tells us a lot about our customers’ journeys within a channel, but we knew we needed to better understand our customers’ journeys across channels. This is a best practice to better understand what a customer experiences, where there are disconnects in information, and where improvements can be made to your website, contact center interactive voice response recordings, or service delivery on any channel.</p>
<h3>Preparation is Key</h3>
<p>We used information in the CX Journey Mapping Toolkit to plan the sessions and our approach. We invited subject matter experts, managers, and other stakeholders to participate in the mapping sessions and designated facilitators to lead the sessions and keep us on track.</p>
<p>One of the most important preparation activities is creating the behavior line. This is the path your customer takes and the journey you’re going to map.</p>
<p>One of USA.gov’s personas, Linda, wants to browse information or learn more on a general topic. We selected “searching for financial assistance from the government” as the topic of Linda’s journey because it’s consistently one of the top reasons customers visit USA.gov&nbsp;or call 1-844-USA-GOV1, and it falls within the persona category.</p>
<p>To create Linda’s behavior line, we looked at:</p>
<ul>
<li>USA.gov Web analytics, including demographics, devices, common paths, popular pages, outbound links, and onsite searches</li>
<li>Web analytics specifically for our <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/benefits-grants-loans"">Government Benefits, Grants, and Loans content</a></li>
<li>USA.gov customer satisfaction survey data</li>
<li>Searches on Google that led customers to USA.gov</li>
<li>Contact center content usage</li>
<li>Web analytics for other government websites available through the Digital Analytics Program</li>
<li>General search trends on Google</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the behavior line was created, we printed each step on one piece of paper. We taped the steps to the wall, with accompanying images, and the facilitators walked the participants through a series of exercises to explore the journey, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employees and systems the customer interacts with personally</li>
<li>Behind-the-scenes employees and systems that support the direct interactions</li>
<li>Customer’s attitudes, emotions, and needs</li>
<li>The highs and lows of the journey</li>
</ul>
<p>After adding multiple rounds of sticky notes and stickers to mark these different factors, we picked the greatest pain points in the journey and brainstormed ways to improve them.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>The four journey mapping sessions generated a total of 110 ideas. Of those ideas, 58 were broad, and many were repeated in each session. Clear themes emerged around areas such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content</li>
<li>Partnerships</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Research</li>
<li>Technology</li>
<li>Contact center operations</li>
</ul>
<p>The journey mapping process and results helped us clearly see the pain points and gaps in the customer’s experience, including channel, content, and device gaps. It also helped to build empathy and increase understanding with our employees.</p>
<h3>Next Steps and Key Takeaways</h3>
<p>While the process of journey mapping is enlightening, it doesn’t end with a map. Follow-up and planning for improvement are key. We’ve incorporated many outcomes from our journey maps into our customer experience (CX)&nbsp;improvement queue. We’ve prioritized several projects into our fourth quarter objectives and key results across our content, user experience, performance measurement, and contact center teams.</p>
<p>Some specific priorities in our CX improvement queue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve our contact center interactive voice response (IVR) menu</li>
<li>Engage partner agency customers in journey mapping exercises that cross our programs</li>
<li>Share our data; make better linkages in results that impact our programs (e.g., search results impact on user experience, content usage on Web and in contact center)</li>
<li>Improve reporting of key results throughout our organization and to senior leadership</li>
<li>Improve customer understanding by using personas and journey maps as a standard process that we incorporate into the beginning of any new project or product</li>
<li>Establish a Customer Advisory Council that includes our agency customers; engage them in our USA.gov transformation efforts and problem solving</li>
</ul>
<p>Journey mapping isn’t a one-and-done project. We are continuing to analyze our results and prioritize&nbsp;areas for improvement, and we’ll continue to map future state journeys to help define desired experiences, keeping the customer at the center of our efforts.</p>

Today, the NBA transmits games in 47 languages to 215 countries across the world. This is a perfect example of how organizations have evolved over time to meet the demands of their audiences.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Evidence like this is the reason many government agencies have launched social media accounts and other digital content dedicated to a Spanish-speaking audience. At USA.gov, we launched our Spanish-language website GobiernoUSA.gov in 2003 (at the time it was called FirstGov en espa√±ol) and launched separate social media accounts in English and Spanish in 2007.</p>
<p>For years, content in English lived on the USA.gov social media channels, and content in Spanish lived on the GobiernoUSA.gov channels. But with experts saying that the <a href=""http://hispanic-marketing.com/hispanic-millennials-require-new-marketing-strategies/"">22.7 million Hispanic millennials in the United States</a> are comfortable going back and forth between both languages, we’re running into a “Spanglish conundrum.”</p>
<h3>The “Spanglish Conundrum”</h3>
<p>If you or your parents were born in a Spanish-speaking country and then came to the United States, odds are you speak at least a little bit of “Spanglish.” You probably feel comfortable moving between both languages and may not even notice when a hybrid Spanish-English word or phrase slips into your conversation.</p>
<p>Communicators trying to reach this growing market segment need to have a plan for how to effectively reach this audience. We’ve seen some examples of this in government already in recent Twitter chats where hashtags have been a mix of Spanish and English words. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has held several Twitter chats using the hashtag <a href=""https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&amp;q=%23oursalud"">#OurSalud</a>.</p>
<p>But we’ve yet to see a cohesive strategy for the best way to approach this.</p>
<p>So, we’re launching a small pilot program on the <a href=""https://twitter.com/USAGovEspanol"" rel="" noopener"">GobiernoUSA.gov</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/USAgov"">USA.gov Twitter accounts</a> where we experiment with bilingual tweets.</p>
<p>The large majority of tweets from the GobiernoUSA.gov account will still be in Spanish, but we plan to mix in some English-language messages that we know will resonate with the bilingual audience.</p>
<p>From the USA.gov account, most messages will be in English but we will retweet messages in Spanish when we know the topic might resonate with the Hispanic audience that consumes information in both languages. For example, recently USA.gov retweeted a <a href=""https://twitter.com/GobiernoUSA/status/603926724347305984"">GobiernoUSA.gov tweet about applying for passports</a>.</p>
<h3>More than a Translation</h3>
<p>Communicating in English through a Spanish channel goes beyond a simple translation. It’s about creating messages for a specific target audience. Much like you consider audiences made up of mothers under 40 or men over 50 when you are drafting content, you should consider the <a href=""https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/05/27/trends-on-tuesday-hispanic-millennials-provide-insight-on-mobile-future/"">Hispanic millennial as a target audience</a>. This audience benefits from English messages through Spanish channels.</p>
<p>In the public sector, some Spanish-language accounts, such as <a href=""https://twitter.com/hhslatino"">HHS Latino</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/lacasablanca"">La Casa Blanca</a>, occasionally post content in English. This “Spanglish” approach is a powerful way to attract a growing audience that moves in between two languages and cultures. This audience might consume information mostly in English, but often they share information in Spanish with friends and family members.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are concepts that are better said in English, especially to an acculturated audience. By translating these concepts you could, in fact, be adding a barrier to message delivery. Our GobiernoUSA.gov accounts try to tackle that conundrum by going beyond translating content. We aim to connect two audiences that have many things in common through a specific communications channel and engage in a real conversation.</p>
<p>Spanglish is here to stay, and a more refined version is coming. You will gradually see more English words in Spanish messages and English messages in what were once “Spanish-only” channels, as more organizations adapt to the demands of this growing audience.</p>

",1970-01-01 00:00:00,2019-08-14T12:13:54.716Z,"<p>The USAGov team plays a challenging, but important role in times of national disaster in helping people across the country prepare for and recover from disasters. To do this, we use different tactics across our channels to ensure we are delivering accurate, helpful information to those who needed it most.</p>
<p><!--more--><span style=""background-color: transparent;"">Here are some implementable tips we have learned to ensure you have the resources and tactics as an organization, federal agency, or media outlet to deliver timely information:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ask your visitors and followers to sign up for emergency alerts</strong>: To ensure those across the country stay aware, urge your followers to sign up for emergency alerts. They can learn what different types of warning alert systems are available to have on their devices in preparation for a natural disaster or emergency. <a href=""https://www.ready.gov/alerts?utm_campaign=%2B%20Disasters%20and%20Emergencies&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--zDCNuIlID_sy7DcaqDVW-_sif-3M7bZrGcW5eG1I2yjesypUNNdbVFAwPIgVxiBLrMVX1"" rel="" noopener"">These text messages, apps, and radio alerts can help anyone have the most updated information available to them.</a></li>
<li><strong>Have a content bank ready to go</strong>: Our organization relies on information developed and shared by agency partners before, during and after an emergency situation. Here are a few of our favorites that include emergency alert sign ups, apps to use on the fly, and storm predictions:</li>
<ol>
<li><a href=""https://www.ready.gov/"">Ready.gov</a> - A public service campaign run through Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) with specific storm pages like <a href=""https://www.ready.gov/hurricanes"">hurricanes</a> and <a href=""http://ready.gov/earthquakes"">earthquakes</a> that include before, during, and after tips.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/disaster-distress-helpline"">Disaster Distress Hotline</a> - A confidential emotional support hotline run by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration available by phone at 1-800-985-5990 or by texting ""TalkWithUs"" to 66746.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/"">The National Hurricane Center</a> - Live maps from the National Weather Service including active storms, week-out projections, and rainfall/flood predictions.</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.usa.gov/disasters-and-emergencies"">USAGov Disaster page</a> - our own summary page updated with information based on specific storms as well as general financial, safety, and preparation links and services.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<li><strong>Follow FEMA accounts</strong>: FEMA shares timely information that people impacted by disasters need. Follow and constantly check social media accounts for immediate updates as a storm develops. FEMA HQ is on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/FEMA/"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/fema/?hl=en"">Instagram</a> and <a href=""http://twitter.com/fema"">Twitter</a>, and has additional accounts across the 10 regions and sub-programs like Ready.gov.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure content is accessible even if there are connectivity issues</strong>: During emergencies, it is very common for areas to have reduced connectivity. Make sure to share information that doesn’t take long to load or requires a strong internet connection. For example,&nbsp; include key information that the public needs to access on the post itself. Don’t make them have to click on a link to get the most essential information as connectivity might be an issue. Don’t rely just on graphics and videos to convey your key messages. People might have problems loading those.</li>
<li><strong>Think about different audiences</strong>: Emergencies can impact all kinds of people. Keep in mind parents caring for young children, <a href=""https://www.ready.gov/animals"">pet owners</a>, senior citizens, limited-English proficient individuals and caregivers, among many others. Creating messaging for different demographic groups and those in various geographic areas means the right people can get the right information to keep themselves safe.</li>
